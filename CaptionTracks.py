    is the most up-to-date video that you
    00:17
    will find four key concept 1.1 please
    00:20
    make sure you go to a push review comm
    00:22
    check out links in the description
    00:24
    I got links to short answer questions
    00:27
    everything you need to prepare for this
    00:29
    test will be found at a push review calm
    00:32
    before we begin it is shoutout time I'm
    00:34
    giving a shout out to my boy mr. Martin
    00:37

    luck to you and your students this year
    00:49
    alright let's take a look and see what
    00:51
    key concept 1.1 says as native
    00:54
    populations migrated and settled across
    00:56
    the vast expanse of North America over
    00:58
    time they develop this stink and
    01:00
    increasingly complex societies by
    01:03
    adapting to in transforming their
    01:05
    diverse environments keep in my native
    01:07
    americans were vastly different from
    01:09
    tribe to tribe a group to group this one
    01:12
    is straight out page 25 of the new
    01:14
    curriculum framework if you don't have
    01:15
    it download it now will be hugely
    01:17
    beneficial i got a link to that too in
    01:19
    the description and the big idea for
    01:21
    this video is how did natives adapt to
    01:24
    their environment be sure to be able to
    01:27
    explain this in case you see it on a
    01:29
    test
    01:30
    alright kicad 7 1.1 roman numeral 1 can
    01:34
    be best described in one word and that
    01:36
    is maize or corn different native
    01:40
    societies adapted to and transform their
    01:42
    environments through innovations in
    01:43
    agriculture resource use and social
    01:46
    structure so we're going to talk about
    01:47
    the impact of maize cultivation or the
    01:49
    growing of maize so it's very popular in
    01:52
    the southwest in present-day new mexico
    01:55
    arizona areas societies developed vast
    01:58
    irrigation systems to bring water to the
    02:00
    maize and we see this especially in the
    02:02
    pueblos near the Rio Grande River so how
    02:06
    exactly does maize transform societies
    02:08
    well there's lots of that emphasis on
    02:10
    hunting and gathering and we see an
    02:11
    increase in population not only for
    02:13
    Europeans when maize wakes is what makes
    02:15
    its way over to Europe but also for
    02:18
    Native Americans and we see the
    02:20
    establishment of permanent villages with
    02:22
    socially diverse societies and these
    02:25
    permanent develop these permanent
    02:27
    villages develop because people are
    02:29
    growing maize and have a constant food
    02:31
    source an example of a socially
    02:33
    diversities Tenno chitlin which is
    02:36
    present-day Mexico City 250,000 people
    02:39
    live there at its height with many
    02:41
    different social classes alright let's
    02:44
    jump on over to the Great Plains and the
    02:45
    Great Basin here in red is the Great
    02:48
    Plains and most natives here lived off
    02:50
    of hunting and gathering there was a
    02:52
    lack of natural resources with the basin
    02:54
    which is kind of on the west coast over
    02:56
    here is a large flat area that was very
    02:58
    arid or dry and the plains were made up
    03:01
    of mostly grassland in the introduction
    03:05
    the horse which will come a little bit
    03:06
    later from the Spanish with this
    03:08
    introduction life on the Great Plains
    03:10
    was drastically altered bison hunting
    03:12
    became much easier natives with horses
    03:14
    became stronger militarily so it was a
    03:16
    huge advantage for natives who had
    03:18
    horses natives in the Great Basin hunted
    03:20
    bison and sheep and like natives on the
    03:23
    Great Plains horses helped natives
    03:25
    become more powerful for those living in
    03:29
    the Great Basin as well alright let's
    03:32
    jump on over to the northeast
    03:34
    Mississippi River Valley and the
    03:35
    Atlantic seaboard many societies here
    03:38
    were a mix of hunting and gathering and
    03:40
    there is agriculture and and agriculture
    03:43
    and they developed permanent villages so
    03:45
    let's take a look at present-day New
    03:46
    York and Pennsylvania we have the
    03:47
    Iroquois nation of Native Americans they
    03:50
    like all many Native Americans adapted
    03:52
    to their environment they did so by
    03:53
    burning forests to hunt and grow crops
    03:55
    and villages were built around maize
    03:57
    again we see the importance of maize in
    03:59
    the air koi were matriarchal society
    04:01
    that means it is a society that has
    04:04
    power based on female Authority so it is
    04:07
    based on the mother's side of the family
    04:09
    not the father's like most European
    04:12
    families women were instrumental in
    04:14
    councils and decision making and women
    04:16
    with tender crops and they oversaw the
    04:18
    community affairs while the men were off
    04:20
    hunting so they played a very
    04:22
    predominant role in society the Cahokia
    04:25
    India
    04:25
    their present-day st. Louis which had
    04:27
    around 30,000 people in 1200 they built
    04:30
    these giant mounds that could be up to
    04:34
    about a hundred feet high and this was
    04:36
    the largest settle community in the
    04:39
    America in present-day America until New
    04:41
    York and Philadelphia surpassed them in
    04:43
    1800
    04:44
    all right the Northwest present-day
    04:46
    California we have roughly 300,000
    04:48
    natives living in California prior to
    04:50
    the arrival of Columbus and other
    04:52
    Europeans most of these societies were
    04:54
    based on hunting gathering and foraging
    04:56
    they would gather nuts fish and they
    04:58
    hunted as well these societies tended to
    05:00
    be ruled by wealthy families we have the
    05:02
    Chinooks who were a group that advocated
    05:06
    warrior traditions and they used advance
    05:07
    fighting techniques and they lived in
    05:09
    long houses which could you house many
    05:12
    families and the use canoes as well for
    05:14
    fishing so let's finish this up with
    05:16
    some test tips well for multiple choices
    05:17
    short answer questions you may see
    05:19
    something like a map of different areas
    05:21
    of North America how the natives have
    05:22
    adapted their environment as a questions
    05:25
    it's not very likely since this is from
    05:27
    period one although you may although you
    05:30
    may see something about Native Americans
    05:31
    that can extend into period two which
    05:33
    we'll talk about in the period two
    05:34
    videos all right guys look forward to
    05:36
    seeing right back here four key concept
    05:38
    1.2 we'll figure out what this
    05:39
    technological advancement is played a
    05:41
    very important role in exploration best

    00:37
    alright so let's take a look at this new
    00:38
    curriculum of ki kasam 1.2 which focuses
    00:41
    on the Columbian Exchange it states
    00:43
    contact among Europeans Native Americans
    00:45
    and Africans resulted in the Columbian
    00:47
    Exchange and significant social cultural
    00:50
    and political changes on both sides of
    00:52
    the Atlantic Ocean check that out on
    00:55
    page 26 of the framework if you don't
    00:57
    have it you must download it follow what
    00:58
    I have a link to it in my in the
    01:00
    description below now big idea the
    01:02
    Columbian Exchange revolutionized life
    01:05
    in the Americas Europe and Africa other
    01:07
    big idea is to think of it questions are
    01:09
    what were positives and negatives of the
    01:11
    Columbian Exchange are both hemispheres
    01:12
    and what were reasons that led to
    01:14
    European exploration alright let's take
    01:17
    a look a key counts of 1.2 Roman numeral
    01:19
    one it states European expansion into
    01:22
    the Western Hemisphere generated intense
    01:24
    social religious political and economic
    01:26
    competition and changes within European
    01:29
    societies again that's right from page
    01:31
    26 so let's explore some reasons for
    01:34
    European exploration get it Explorer ok
    01:38
    let's just move on country sought new
    01:40
    sources of wealth weather was gold and
    01:42
    or silver but especially gold there also
    01:46
    was economic and military competition
    01:48
    this idea of glory and each nation
    01:50
    wanted to be the best will see that the
    01:52
    English get involved in period 2 as a
    01:54
    result of the defeat of the Spanish
    01:55
    Armada in the late 16th century we see
    01:59
    the spread of Christianity as a major
    02:01
    motive particularly when it comes to
    02:03
    Spain and the Spanish often try to
    02:05
    convert natives to Christianity they did
    02:07
    so through the Spanish mission system
    02:09
    which were outpost throughout the
    02:11
    Americas to help convert natives and
    02:13
    they
    02:13
    off they often were military bases as
    02:16
    well think of the three G's when it
    02:19
    comes to European exploration this could
    02:20
    be a great short answer question briefly
    02:22
    explain a reason for European
    02:25
    exploration of the new world think of
    02:27
    the 3 G's gold glory gospel so you've
    02:30
    got gold or money glory or fame and the
    02:33
    gospel religion or God all right so what
    02:36
    are the impacts of the Columbian
    02:37
    Exchange well again first of all what is
    02:39
    the Columbian Exchange is exchange of
    02:41
    plants animals culture humans diseases
    02:43
    etc between the Americas Europe and
    02:46
    Africa so what are some examples of
    02:48
    goods well from the Americas to Europe
    02:50
    in Africa we have potatoes and we also
    02:54
    have maize which we talked about in the
    02:56
    key concept 1.1 video do you remember
    02:59
    where maize was mostly cultivated yeah
    03:02
    that's right your genius in the
    03:03
    southwest portion of the present United
    03:06
    States we also have tomatoes and just
    03:08
    look at that delicious baked potato
    03:10
    mm-hmm are you butter sour cream person
    03:12
    I think I'm sour cream but I'm not sure
    03:15
    all right from Europe to the Americas we
    03:17
    have things like wheat and rice and
    03:19
    horses and chickens in oxen lots of
    03:22
    livestock and perhaps none more
    03:24
    important for Native Americans than the
    03:27
    horse going back to key concept one
    03:29
    point one we're in North America did the
    03:32
    horse impact in Native Americans yep
    03:35
    you're right it was the Great Plains and
    03:37
    the great bison look at you you little
    03:39
    genius so what are some impacts of the
    03:40
    exchange well in Europe and Asia we see
    03:42
    a massive population growth due to new
    03:44
    food see an increase in wealth and a
    03:46
    decrease in feudalism and the beginnings
    03:49
    of the rise of capitalism in Africa we
    03:51
    see the Spanish and the Portuguese they
    03:53
    use Africans from West Africa do bees
    03:55
    use the slaves in the Americas and in
    03:57
    the Americas we see this spread of
    03:59
    diseases particularly smallpox and
    04:01
    measles that killed many Native
    04:04
    Americans we see the emergence of social
    04:06
    classes a group like the mestizos which
    04:08
    are people of mixed Native American and
    04:11
    European ancestry and also the horse
    04:13
    transformed Native life by making
    04:15
    hunting easier on the Great Plains in
    04:17
    the Great Basin we also then comiendo
    04:19
    system emerges as well which we're
    04:21
    talking about just a minute plus I got a
    04:23
    video for it in the description I got
    04:24
    you covered
    04:25
    all right so talk about technology
    04:27
    and trade there are some reasons why the
    04:29
    Europeans were able to explore and
    04:30
    that's because of new technology we have
    04:32
    this sextant this is a piece of
    04:34
    technology that could be used to find
    04:36
    the exact position on earth which led to
    04:38
    more precise sailing basically this bad
    04:41
    boy is like the first GPS for ships we
    04:46
    have the caravel which was a ship
    04:48
    introduced by the Portuguese that
    04:49
    allowed for faster travel we have the
    04:51
    compass and the quadrant which also
    04:53
    improved saline efficiency when it comes
    04:56
    to economic improvements think of things
    04:58
    like the joint stock company which is
    05:00
    basically a front-runner for the modern
    05:03
    day corporation which people pool their
    05:04
    money together and they share the
    05:07
    profits and losses of a colony and we'll
    05:09
    see this used in Jamestown which was
    05:11
    founded by the British in 1607 more on
    05:15
    that in the next video all right he got
    05:17
    some one point two Roman numeral two the
    05:19
    Columbian Exchange and development the
    05:21
    Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere
    05:22
    resulted in an extensive demographic
    05:25
    economic and social changes so what is
    05:29
    the impact of Spanish exploration well
    05:31
    again we talked about deadly diseases
    05:32
    things like smallpox and malaria here is
    05:35
    a drawing from the Aztec empire of
    05:38
    people encountering these diseases and
    05:40
    in some areas that killed as many as 90%
    05:42
    of Native Americans because they were
    05:44
    not immune to these European diseases
    05:46
    again we have their introduction new
    05:49
    animals and crops that we mentioned
    05:50
    especially the horse I can't stress that
    05:52
    enough how important that is for Native
    05:54
    Americans and also crops food is brought
    05:57
    over such as wheat rice and sugar which
    05:59
    will play a prominent role in
    06:01
    agriculture and cash crops later right
    06:05
    the encomienda system have more detailed
    06:07
    video they could check out in the
    06:09
    description this was when Native
    06:10
    American labor was marshaled please make
    06:13
    sure you know this term marshal it is in
    06:15
    the curriculum you could see it in a
    06:17
    multiple choice question and if you
    06:18
    don't know what it is it'll be difficult
    06:19
    to answer this means to arrange or
    06:22
    assembled and they Native Americans were
    06:24
    marshaled on plantations or forced to
    06:27
    work on plantations the goal was used to
    06:29
    labor for agriculture and gain precious
    06:32
    metals like gold and silver from mines
    06:35
    eventually the in comiendo system is
    06:38
    going to be replaced by Africa
    06:39
    slave labor mostly because the live
    06:42
    Native Americans died but they also run
    06:43
    away because they know the land the new
    06:46
    laws of 1542 for example these were
    06:48
    Spanish laws that outlaw then comme en
    06:50
    de system now the Spanish and Portuguese
    06:52
    traders they acquired slaves from West
    06:54
    African groups and the slaves were used
    06:57
    by the Spanish on plantations and mines
    06:59
    so they kind of replace the in comida
    07:01
    system Spanish caste system emerges and
    07:04
    this incorporated Europeans Africans and
    07:07
    natives and we see at the top of the
    07:09
    Europeans if you took a world history
    07:10
    class or a global class you remember the
    07:12
    peninsulares those that were born in
    07:14
    Spain the Creoles are 100% Spanish that
    07:18
    were born in the colonies then we see
    07:19
    groups like mestizos and mulatos and
    07:22
    mestizos were mixed European and Native
    07:24
    American and a lot of those were of
    07:26
    mixed European and African ancestry and
    07:29
    here is a painting of a mestizo child
    07:33
    all right eke out some 1.2 Roman numeral
    07:36
    three and their interactions Europeans
    07:38
    and Native Americans asserted divergent
    07:41
    worldviews regarding issues such as
    07:42
    religion gender roles family land use
    07:45
    and power there's this misunderstanding
    07:47
    between each group of each other when it
    07:50
    comes to gender roles many Native
    07:52
    American societies as we talked about ki
    07:54
    kasam 1.1 or matrilineal whereas in
    07:57
    Europe they're based on the male side or
    08:00
    the father side of the family land there
    08:02
    are different concepts of land Europeans
    08:05
    believed in individual land ownership
    08:07
    where natives did not they believed in
    08:08
    it in terms of a community it belonged
    08:10
    to everybody
    08:11
    religion native Native Americans tended
    08:14
    to believe in animism or this belief is
    08:15
    spirits in nature and they also tend to
    08:17
    be polytheistic and shamans or medicine
    08:20
    men held tremendous power all of those
    08:22
    rank contradictory to Christianity which
    08:25
    was practiced by Europeans there were
    08:29
    some usable useful aspects of each
    08:31
    other's cultures that were eventually
    08:32
    adapted natives adapted various
    08:34
    technology things like horses things
    08:37
    like guns and horses as well although
    08:39
    that's not technology and Europeans
    08:41
    adapted agricultural techniques from
    08:44
    Native Americans native resistance to
    08:47
    European encroachment and labour
    08:49
    occurred and encroachment means kind of
    08:51
    like coming
    08:51
    onto somebody's land or somebody's space
    08:54
    and natives sought to preserve political
    08:56
    economic and religious autonomy
    08:58
    everybody do me a favor and make sure
    09:00
    you know this word autonomy for using
    09:03
    the fill-in-the-blank guide for this
    09:04
    video circle and right now my students
    09:06
    circle it this means independence or
    09:08
    self-rule in America today people become
    09:12
    autonomous when they're 18 years old
    09:14
    when they're legally adults and they try
    09:17
    to do so diplomatically and or
    09:18
    militarily and there were debates over
    09:20
    how non-european should be treated how
    09:23
    should Africans and natives be treated
    09:26
    by Europeans well many Europeans all
    09:28
    natives and Africans as savages as less
    09:31
    than human one discipline ADA he was
    09:35
    this guy that advocated harsh treatment
    09:36
    of the natives and he claimed that
    09:37
    slavery for natives was justified under
    09:40
    Christianity on the opposite end you
    09:42
    have this do Bartolome de las casas and
    09:44
    he argued that the natives deserved the
    09:46
    same treatment as all other men and he
    09:48
    played an instrumental role in the
    09:50
    ending of encomienda system and
    09:51
    contributed to this idea the black
    09:53
    legend that the Spanish really
    09:55
    contributed to a lot of destruction of
    09:57
    Native American society and what were
    10:00
    arguments used to subjugate Africans and
    10:02
    natives well we have racism we we have
    10:04
    religious reasons and also this idea
    10:06
    that natives and Africans were seen as
    10:08
    barbaric or savages all right we'll
    10:10
    finish up with some tests tips for
    10:11
    multiple choice and short answer be
    10:13
    familiar with the impacts of the
    10:14
    Columbian Exchange not just food think
    10:17
    about disease - you've increased some
    10:19
    World Trade firmly connecting two
    10:20
    hemispheres be able to identify specific
    10:23
    Goods and their impacts what comes to
    10:25
    mind right away from me is the horse the
    10:27
    impact the horse had on Native Americans
    10:29
    impact the potato head on Europe and
    10:32
    also then comiendo system as well impact
    10:35
    on Africans we see drastic growth in
    10:38
    slavery which we'll talk about more in
    10:39
    key concept 2.1 and four essay questions
    10:42
    European interactions with Native
    10:44
    Americans and we'll talk more about that
    10:46
    in period two again you will not see an
    10:48
    essay exclusively from period one it
    10:49
    would be a combination of period 1 & 2
    10:51
    this could also be a part of a larger
    10:53
    topic comparing Spanish colonization
    10:55
    with other European countries which we
    10:59
    will talk about the English and the
    11:00

    00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,750
    about the new curriculum inin comme un

    14
    00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,880
    des welke cards have 1.2 Roman numeral 1

    15
    00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,969
    letter D States in the economies of the

    16
    00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,760
    Spanish colonies ending labor using the

    17
    00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,620
    encomienda system to support validation

    18
    00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,500
    based agriculture and extract precious

    19
    00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,930
    metals and other resources was gradually

    20
    00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,719
    replaced by African slavery this is from

    21
    00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,700
    page 24 of the new curriculum framework

    22
    00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,230
    so since then commando system is

    23
    00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,969
    specifically mentioned in the framework

    24
    00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,219
    there is a good chance that you will be

    25
    00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,440
    directly assessed on it let's get going

    26
    00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,510
    and talking about what exactly is this

    27
    00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,309
    and comiendo system well background in

    28
    00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,010
    front this takes place in the early 16th

    29
    00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,130
    century so talking about the early 1500s

    30
    00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,740
    here and this was a Spanish system of

    31
    00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,560
    control over natives and much of the

    32
    00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,470
    Americas and we have this guy Nicolas de

    33
    00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,659
    ovando who's really kind of the creator

    34
    00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,970
    of this so what did it do well they were

    35
    00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,610
    royal grants of land from the Spanish

    36
    00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,070
    crown to various Spaniards and and

    37
    00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,680
    return for receiving these royal grants

    38
    00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,350
    of land the splint Spanish promised to

    39
    00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,240
    Christianize the natives living on the

    40
    00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,119
    lands they promised to convert them to

    41
    00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,920
    Christianity the Spanish also gained

    42
    00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,020
    tribute from the natives which was a

    43
    00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
    form of payment whether it was in labor

    44
    00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,570
    or actual payment so how were the

    45
    00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,840
    natives affected by this they most of

    46
    00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,030
    them were treated very harshly and they

    47
    00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,520
    would do heavy manual labor such as

    48
    00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,790
    building roads and infrastructure it was

    49
    00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,130
    very hard work for natives to do the in

    50
    00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,500
    command Eze became wealthy due to the

    51
    00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,170
    discovery of gold and silver and spain

    52
    00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,390
    discovered an insane amount of gold and

    53
    00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,690
    silver in the Americas and they became

    54
    00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,640
    very very very wealthy alright so why

    55
    00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,890
    does this a command a system fall apart

    56
    00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,140
    well many Catholics began to approach

    57
    00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,750
    test the harsh treatment of the natives

    58
    00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,990
    including this guy Bartolome de la Casas

    59
    00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,790
    he was very influential and urged that

    60
    00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,360
    Native Americans should be treated more

    61
    00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,420
    fairly and equally we also have mestizos

    62
    00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,730
    which are individuals who are of Spanish

    63
    00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,700
    and Native American ancestry and here is

    64
    00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,770
    a picture of a mestizo baby there were

    65
    00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,900
    laws that were made that that mestizos

    66
    00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,880
    could not be forced to work and then Co

    67
    00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,239
    me in the system so as time went on more

    68
    00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,670
    and more mestizos were being born and

    69
    00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,950
    thus less people were available to work

    70
    00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,690
    and then Co me in the system and in time

    71
    00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,560
    this helped lead to the decline of the

    72
    00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,930
    in communist gradually the system was

    73
    00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,720
    replaced by African slave labor like

    74
    00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,519
    many area up like many areas of the

    75
    00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,530
    America and another big reason was the

    76
    00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,019
    Africans were more immune to European

    77
    00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,080
    diseases than were natives once

    78
    00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,850
    Europeans reach the Americas a

    79
    00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,000
    significant majority of Native American

    80
    00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,100
    populations were reduced due to disease

    81
    00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,600
    alright let's go over some test tips

    82
    00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,950
    multiple choice questions in short

    83
    00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,829
    answer definitely know that they've

    84
    00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,170
    comiendo system was Indian slave labor

    85
    00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,090
    by another name it was it was

    86
    00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,190
    essentially slavery even though it was

    87
    00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,200
    called in Commandos and this is

    88
    00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,690
    gradually replaced by African slave

    89
    00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,310
    labor as we just talked about as a

    90
    00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,140
    questions you are not likely to see

    91
    00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,760
    instances from the first time period if

    92
    00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,769
    you do see something from the first time

    93
    00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,870
    period it will be asked in conjunction

    94
    00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,450
    with another time period so you will not

    95
    00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,329
    see something solely from the first time

    96
    00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,470

    00:03
    hey what's going on and push people we
    00:06
    have key concept 2.1 for you today this
    00:09
    one is from period 2 and is updated for
    00:11
    the 2015 revision so this is the most
    00:14
    up-to-date video you will find on key
    00:17
    concept 2.1 alright let's take a look
    00:19
    and see what it says it says europeans
    00:21
    developed a variety of colonisation and
    00:23
    migration patterns influenced by
    00:25
    different imperial goals cultures and
    00:27
    the varied North American environments
    00:29
    where they settled and they competed
    00:33
    with each other and American Indians for
    00:36
    resources this is front page 30 of the
    00:38
    curriculum framework so big idea
    00:40
    questions to think about as you watch
    00:41
    this video what were similarities in
    00:43
    colonization among the Spanish French
    00:45
    Dutch and English
    00:47
    what were the experiences like with
    00:49
    Native Americans with these European
    00:50
    countries how and why did slavery evolve
    00:53
    in these colonies and how did climate in
    00:55
    geography affect British colonies
    00:57
    alright let's take a look at Roman
    00:59
    numeral 1 it it states Spanish French
    01:02
    Dutch and British colonizers had
    01:03
    different economic and imperial goals
    01:06
    involving land and labour that shaped
    01:08
    the social and political development of
    01:10
    their colonies as well as their
    01:12
    relationships with native populations
    01:14
    this is screening to me a short answer
    01:17
    or an essay topic about comparing and
    01:19
    contrasting these different European
    01:22
    imperial goals
    01:24
    alright so letter A Spain establish
    01:26
    strict control over colonization and
    01:28
    they converted and Exploited many Native
    01:31
    Americans and a major goal of Spain was
    01:35
    to make money or gold from the three
    01:37
    geez we talked about in the first key
    01:39
    concept all trade must go through a few
    01:42
    Spanish controlled port so they really
    01:44
    had their hand firmly around the
    01:47
    economies of these colonies a small
    01:50
    amount of Spaniards ruled the indigenous
    01:51
    population and we'll compare that later
    01:53
    with English which sent a lot of people
    01:55
    and the Spain sought to convert natives
    01:57
    to Christianity and they forced money
    01:59
    into the in comiendo system and they use
    02:02
    the natives as trading partners now
    02:04
    remember we talked about that comiendo
    02:05
    system in the last video and this was
    02:07
    basically slavery for the Native
    02:09
    Americans now when we're talking about
    02:10
    French and Dutch colonization but
    02:13
    of those countries sent few Europeans
    02:14
    and they built relationships with the
    02:16
    natives
    02:17
    the French often intermarried with the
    02:19
    natives and they built extensive trading
    02:21
    partnership so really they had pretty
    02:23
    good relations with the natives Cober de
    02:26
    bois were these French fur traders and
    02:28
    they would trade beaver furs and they
    02:29
    would live among the natives they had
    02:32
    friendly relations with the natives the
    02:34
    Dutch like the French the Dutch built
    02:36
    extensive trade routes mostly in
    02:38
    present-day New York in near New York
    02:41
    City and they encouraged settlement of
    02:43
    the new world through New Netherland
    02:45
    Rhys talked about English colonization
    02:48
    the most different from all the European
    02:51
    powers they sent a large number of
    02:52
    immigrants both male and female
    02:55
    unlike other European countries
    02:58
    everybody do me a favor and circle male
    02:59
    and female that's an important thing to
    03:01
    know wasn't just men that were sent over
    03:03
    it they were females as well the English
    03:06
    saw economic prosperity they want to
    03:08
    religious freedom especially for those
    03:10
    Puritans they want to be able to
    03:11
    practice the religion without
    03:12
    persecution and they wanted better
    03:14
    living conditions England was very
    03:16
    overcrowded during this time the English
    03:19
    colonies also welcomed immigrants from
    03:21
    other countries and the counties were
    03:23
    based on agriculture including the New
    03:26
    England colonies tobacco became a major
    03:28
    major cash crop for the English colonies
    03:31
    and brought a lot of wealth the
    03:33
    headright system encouraged immigrants
    03:35
    in the head rate system would benefit
    03:37
    the wealthy because every person who
    03:39
    paid for an indentured servant to come
    03:40
    to the new world would gain 50 acres of
    03:42
    land now unlike the French of the
    03:45
    Spanish the English colonists ought to
    03:46
    live separately from native americans
    03:48
    again the French and the Spanish with
    03:50
    intermarry with the natives they would
    03:52
    have trade alliances with them but the
    03:53
    English really lived entirely separate
    03:56
    from the Native Americans in there
    03:59
    emerges conflicts with Native Americans
    04:00
    such as the Powhatan zhh Bacon's
    04:02
    Rebellion which was a rebellion of many
    04:05
    former detchard servants who were upset
    04:07
    about a lack of protection on the
    04:09
    frontier in Jamestown Virginia from
    04:11
    Native Americans the Pequot War and also
    04:14
    Kings felt King Phillip's war in New
    04:16
    England which I do have a video on check
    04:18
    the description for that alright let's
    04:21
    take a look at Roman numeral tuinal in
    04:23
    the 17th century early British colonies
    04:25
    developed along the
    04:25
    Lanta coast with regional differences
    04:27
    that reflected various environmental
    04:30
    economic cultural and demographic
    04:31
    factors so we're really going to get
    04:33
    into the makeup of the British colonies
    04:36
    well the Chesapeake colonies please know
    04:38
    this this is specific to two colonies
    04:41
    Maryland and Virginia when we're talking
    04:43
    about the Chesapeake colonies and we're
    04:45
    talking about North Carolina they're
    04:46
    going to really heavily focus on tobacco
    04:49
    and as a result plantations will develop
    04:51
    that really do nothing but grow tobacco
    04:54
    and this will lead to long workdays and
    04:56
    growing seasons as well
    04:58
    tobacco exhausts land and this will lead
    05:02
    to expansion and then conflicts with
    05:04
    natives that are living on this land so
    05:06
    again the more the colonists expand the
    05:09
    more they're going to encroach on Native
    05:10
    American land and lead to expansion so
    05:12
    again that idea of Baker's rebellion
    05:14
    that we're talking about English
    05:15
    colonists in Jamestown were upset that
    05:17
    they felt they did not have adequate
    05:19
    protection from the governor of Virginia
    05:21
    against the natives up to the 17th
    05:24
    century so most of the 1600s most of the
    05:27
    labor was made up of the indent of
    05:29
    indentured servants now after Bacon's
    05:31
    Rebellion which was made up of mostly in
    05:33
    Dutchess servants plantation owners
    05:34
    begin to move away from it entered
    05:36
    servants because they eventually get the
    05:38
    freedom in watt land and there was a
    05:40
    switch more towards African slavery so
    05:42
    if you're writing a short answer and
    05:43
    essay topic about the growth of slavery
    05:45
    you can absolutely talk about a shortage
    05:48
    of indentured servants or a conflict
    05:50
    like Bacon's Rebellion
    05:51
    now let's jump up to the New England
    05:52
    colonies in the north they were
    05:54
    established by Puritans these were
    05:55
    people who wanted to purify the Anglican
    05:57
    Church not break away from it dudes like
    05:59
    this guy John Winthrop and they
    06:01
    established small towns with small farms
    06:03
    schools were established for towns with
    06:06
    50 families and that was important to
    06:08
    instill reading and writing so people
    06:10
    could reach so children could grow up to
    06:11
    read the Bible and extended families
    06:13
    were much more common in New England
    06:15
    than they were in the middle colonies or
    06:17
    the south there was some agriculture
    06:19
    also fishing and commerce in Boston in
    06:22
    particular is going to become a major
    06:23
    port city for trade there's a colder
    06:26
    climate and the rocky terrain did not
    06:28
    allow for large plantations that you see
    06:30
    in the south with a very flat to warm
    06:33
    long growing seasons
    06:34
    alright the middle colonies these tended
    06:36
    to be the most diverse demographically
    06:38
    religiously
    06:39
    ethnically out of all the colonies with
    06:41
    the Quakers in Pennsylvania which was
    06:43
    established by William Penn they were
    06:45
    very religiously tolerant women in
    06:47
    Pennsylvania had more rights than other
    06:49
    counties the Quakers allowed women equal
    06:51
    positions in church and they were
    06:53
    allowed to speak in church ceremonies as
    06:55
    well and they also had more immigrants
    06:57
    from other countries besides just
    06:59
    England immigrants came from what is
    07:01
    present-day Germany as well the economy
    07:04
    was based on the exportation of cereal
    07:06
    crops such as wheat so lots of
    07:07
    Agriculture happening there now let's go
    07:10
    down to the southern colonies places
    07:11
    like South Carolina and Georgia and then
    07:13
    in the Caribbean we're going to see rice
    07:15
    as a major staple crop this is very
    07:18
    arduous labor there are incredibly long
    07:20
    days and a long growing seasons there
    07:23
    would be lots of disease as well from
    07:25
    the swamps and mosquitos that would
    07:27
    carry diseases many white laborers
    07:29
    refused to work in these rice fields
    07:32
    which would lead to an increase in slave
    07:34
    labor in this area in the West Indies
    07:38
    and Barbados in particular you see sugar
    07:40
    cultivation which is a major part of the
    07:41
    economy and like South Carolina and
    07:44
    Georgia slave labor was heavily used in
    07:46
    the Caribbean and in many instances in
    07:48
    the West Indies slaves made up a
    07:50
    majority of the population and this is
    07:52
    going to lead to the development of
    07:54
    really strict slave codes or laws to
    07:57
    regulate slave behavior these laws would
    08:00
    give incredible power to slave owners
    08:02
    the emergent there became an emergence
    08:05
    of a democratic self-government in the
    08:07
    British colonies and we'll find our line
    08:08
    this is really this was really caused by
    08:10
    distance from Brent since the colonies
    08:12
    were so far away Britain really didn't
    08:14
    have as much control and there was lacks
    08:17
    attention or this idea known as salutary
    08:19
    neglect and Britain really kind of takes
    08:21
    a hands-off approach to the colonies as
    08:23
    long as they're you know making money
    08:25
    and being peaceful and not really going
    08:26
    against British ideals we see in New
    08:29
    England the development of colonial
    08:31
    government through town meetings and
    08:32
    these people would be able to elect
    08:34
    legislators and the people who could
    08:36
    vote we're limited at the time to white
    08:39
    land owning church members but it really
    08:41
    was an incredible form of democracy for
    08:43
    its time in the south we see planners
    08:46
    dominating assemblies things like the
    08:48
    Virginia House of Burgesses here's a
    08:49
    replica here you can go to Colonial
    08:51
    Williamsburg
    08:52
    and actually step foot in this room this
    08:54
    was the first representative government
    08:56
    in the British colonies and many of its
    08:58
    members were elite plantation owners and
    09:01
    that if you were to look at the last
    09:04
    names of members you'll see famous names
    09:06
    like Jefferson Thomas Jefferson's father
    09:09
    was a member of the House of Burgesses
    09:11
    alright we'll finish up jumping over the
    09:18
    key concept to point one Roman numeral
    09:20
    three competition over resources between
    09:22
    European rivals and American Indians
    09:23
    encouraged industry and trade that led
    09:26
    to conflict in the America so the land
    09:28
    economy emerges this is exchange of
    09:31
    goods African Americans and Native
    09:34
    Americans between Europe Africa and the
    09:36
    Americas and this really is the
    09:39
    Columbian Exchange the continuation of
    09:41
    the Columbian Exchange we talked about
    09:42
    in period one European colonies focused
    09:45
    on producing goods to Europe this is
    09:47
    mercantilism the idea that colonies
    09:49
    produced goods for the mother country
    09:51
    and goods that were valued in Europe
    09:53
    were exported from the colony
    09:54
    specifically items like fur and tobacco
    09:57
    this helps lead to new sources of labor
    10:00
    initially it was Native American labor
    10:01
    then it was replaced by with indentured
    10:04
    servant labor and then finally African
    10:06
    slave labor so what is impact the
    10:08
    impacts of trade on natives well we have
    10:10
    cultural changes the natives lost many
    10:12
    land the natives lost much of their land
    10:14
    and many Europeans ought to assimilate
    10:17
    Native Americans we have economic
    10:19
    changes as well land was lost and
    10:21
    altered by Europeans and their way of
    10:22
    life was shifted as a result of this
    10:25
    loss of land demographic changes is what
    10:28
    we've talked about the the impact of
    10:31
    disease on decreasing the population for
    10:34
    Native Americans interactions between
    10:36
    Native Americans and Europeans on this
    10:39
    term fostered is used in the curriculum
    10:41
    please make sure you know this it means
    10:42
    to promote the growth of so interactions
    10:45
    fostered both accommodation and conflict
    10:48
    and Europeans allied with native groups
    10:51
    against opposing native groups and we
    10:53
    see this in the Pequot War meta comms
    10:55
    war or King Philip's War in which
    10:57
    Europeans would kind of a lot allied
    11:00
    themselves with one group of Native
    11:01
    Americans against their enemies and the
    11:03
    British raid will offer more Goods than
    11:05
    natives whereas the
    11:06
    were more tolerant of natives again
    11:09
    going back to the idea of intermarrying
    11:10
    with them so it's kind of a trade-off
    11:12
    for Native Americans with who they want
    11:14
    to ally with during the French and
    11:16
    Indian War which we'll talk about more
    11:17
    in Period three almost all natives were
    11:21
    allied with the French except for the
    11:23
    Iroquois Native Americans and European
    11:26
    colonial interests are often going to
    11:28
    vary or they will have different
    11:30
    interest in what they hope to hit and
    11:33
    they will often have different goals and
    11:36
    interests both sides increasingly began
    11:38
    to distrust each other as time went on
    11:40
    British colonists sought to expand they
    11:42
    wanted more land whereas Britain really
    11:44
    pushed to contain the colonists due to
    11:47
    conflict with Native Americans and we'll
    11:49
    see this especially in 1763 with this
    11:51
    line here the proclamation line of 1763
    11:54
    which will forbid expansion past the
    11:57
    Appalachian Mountains and frontier
    11:59
    defense became a major issue again seen
    12:02
    in Bacon's Rebellion I've talked about
    12:04
    that several times now this idea of
    12:06
    colonists wanting protection from Native
    12:08
    Americans on the outskirts of towns or
    12:11
    cities and trade also divided the two
    12:13
    groups colonists smuggled to get around
    12:16
    British taxes alright British and Native
    12:20
    American conflicts were caused by
    12:21
    competition over land resources and
    12:23
    boundaries and this would lead to
    12:25
    military conflicts specifically
    12:27
    medicham's war King Philip's War again I
    12:28
    have a video in the description to check
    12:30
    out this was a conflict between natives
    12:32
    and British colonists in New England the
    12:34
    natives were defeated and really from
    12:36
    that moment forward in New England they
    12:38
    were not much of a threat to the
    12:39
    colonists the Spanish and Native
    12:41
    American it comes to Spanish and Native
    12:43
    American resistance we see the Pueblo
    12:45
    Revolt in New Mexico present-day New
    12:47
    Mexico the Pueblo Indians successfully
    12:49
    overthrew the Spanish for twelve years
    12:51
    and after the Spanish regained control
    12:53
    they became much more accommodating to
    12:55
    Native American culture particularly
    12:56
    religion so even though the Spanish
    12:58
    regained control they become much more
    13:01
    accommodating or accepting of Native
    13:03
    Americans alright let's finish up with
    13:06
    some tests tips from multiple choice and
    13:08
    short answer questions be able to
    13:10
    identify and explain goals of European
    13:12
    colonization the differences between the
    13:14
    British and other colonies and comparing
    13:16
    British colonies to other British
    13:19
    colonies so for
    13:20
    New England to the Chesapeake how do
    13:22
    they differ and hardly similar
    13:24
    geographically religion religiously and
    13:26
    economically for essay questions you
    13:29
    could see something along lines of the
    13:30
    reasons for the development of slavery
    13:32
    and comparing and contrasting European
    13:34
    colonization French Spanish and English
    13:36
    and I do have a detailed video on that
    13:38
    as well we're actually break it down as
    13:40
    to how could be how there could be an
    13:43
    essay on it check the description for
    13:44
    that as well
    13:45
    alright guys look forward to seeing you
    13:47
    right back here four key concepts 2.2
    13:49
    we'll figure out who this dude is

    00:04
    hey what's up a push peeps this is your
    00:06
    boy Adam Norris here with kicad said two
    00:09
    point two for you today this one is
    00:10
    updated the most up-to-date video you
    00:13
    will find a key concept to point to
    00:15
    alright let's take a look and see what
    00:16
    it says
    00:17
    the British counties participated in
    00:19
    political cultural and economic
    00:21
    exchanges with Great Britain that
    00:23
    encouraged both stronger bonds with
    00:25
    Britain and resistance to Britain's
    00:28
    control I don't know about you that is
    00:30
    screaming to meet changing continuity
    00:33
    that is something that aap really wants
    00:35
    you to understand what changed during a
    00:37
    time period in what remained the same so
    00:40
    the countess and Great Britain
    00:42
    encouraged stronger bonds so exchanges
    00:44
    encourage stronger bonds that's going to
    00:46
    be the continuity but it also encouraged
    00:49
    resistance and that's going to be the
    00:51
    change so keep that in mind as we watch
    00:53
    this video so some big ideas how did the
    00:56
    colonists begin to develop an identity
    00:58
    during this time what impacted religion
    01:01
    have on the colonies and why did slavery
    01:03
    develop in the British colonies you
    01:05
    should know that already a little bit at
    01:07
    least from key cuts of 2.1 with Bacon's
    01:10
    Rebellion and furthermore how did
    01:12
    Africans resist their conditions okay
    01:15
    let's take a look at 2.2 Roman numeral
    01:17
    one transatlantic commercial religious
    01:19
    philosophical and political exchanges
    01:21
    led residents of the British colonies to
    01:24
    evolve in their political and cultural
    01:25
    attitudes as they became increasingly
    01:27
    tied to Britain and one another so we're
    01:30
    going to see more interdependence here
    01:32
    among the colonies and Britain so we see
    01:35
    the emergence of diverse religious and
    01:37
    ethnic groups Catholics especially in
    01:39
    Maryland with the Maryland acts of
    01:40
    toleration which granted religious
    01:42
    tolerance to Christians only and it was
    01:45
    aimed at protecting Catholics the
    01:47
    Quakers of Pennsylvania and Puritans
    01:49
    in New England so we've lured Baltimore
    01:51
    who is the famous Catholic William Penn
    01:54
    the Quaker and John Winthrop the Puritan
    01:57
    so pluralism what is pluralism well it's
    01:59
    this idea that multiple groups are
    02:01
    existing together at the same time it
    02:04
    will also lead to intellectual exchange
    02:07
    from different European groups so not
    02:09
    just England will ideas be coming from
    02:11
    in regards to Europe but also
    02:13
    other areas the areas of present-day
    02:16
    Germany as well Pennsylvania will see a
    02:19
    lot of immigrants coming from that area
    02:22
    now these diverse religious and ethnic
    02:25
    groups are going to strain are going to
    02:26
    be strengthened by the first Great
    02:28
    Awakening people like this dude George
    02:30
    Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards who
    02:32
    happen to be the grandfather to vice
    02:34
    president Aaron Burr who shot and killed
    02:37
    Alexander Hamilton in 1804 now this is
    02:40
    going to lead to increase in conversions
    02:43
    of first Great Awakening and new
    02:45
    branches of Christianity as well I have
    02:47
    a video in the description that goes a
    02:48
    much more detail with of than about the
    02:51
    first Great Awakening but the big idea
    02:53
    people are being brought back to
    02:55
    religion and more conversions and new
    02:58
    branches of Christianity this will lead
    03:00
    to questioning of authority also the
    03:03
    Enlightenment is occurring in Europe and
    03:04
    this leads to the questioning of
    03:06
    government people like John Locke right
    03:09
    about natural rights life liberty and
    03:11
    property and Montesquieu writes about
    03:13
    separation of powers why know how I
    03:14
    remember Montesquieu Montesquieu that's
    03:17
    three syllables separation of powers
    03:19
    three words so let it be how do the
    03:23
    British counties experience
    03:25
    anglicisation everybody circle for me
    03:27
    Anglican especially my students this
    03:29
    means using more English norms and
    03:31
    customs this is going to happen over
    03:33
    time well it does so by colonial
    03:35
    governments were based on English model
    03:37
    so the government structure is based on
    03:39
    England
    03:40
    what frequent contact with Britain via
    03:42
    the transatlantic print cultures so
    03:44
    ideas are being spread from England all
    03:47
    the way over to the Americas especially
    03:50
    via trade in newspapers and we're going
    03:52
    to have the spread of Protestant
    03:54
    evangelism again this idea of the first
    03:57
    Great Awakening George Whitefield he's
    03:59
    originally from England he and others
    04:01
    come across the Atlantic to the colonies
    04:03
    to spread their message and encourage
    04:06
    conversion in new branches of
    04:08
    Christianity the British sought to
    04:10
    increase control of its colonies through
    04:11
    its pursuit of mercantilism and
    04:13
    mercantilism is important to know it's
    04:15
    the idea that the colonies exist for the
    04:17
    benefit of the mother country and when
    04:20
    there were conflicts with colonists and
    04:21
    natives this would lead to erratic or
    04:23
    inconsistent enforcement Britain sought
    04:27
    to
    04:27
    make colonial expansion to limit
    04:29
    conflict with natives and we'll see this
    04:31
    especially after 1763 at the end of the
    04:35
    Seven Years War the French in nur also
    04:37
    the navigation axes require colonists to
    04:40
    export specific Goods only to England
    04:42
    like tobacco or English colonies and
    04:45
    whether it was tobacco or for other
    04:47
    goods that the colonists were only
    04:49
    expected to trade with Britain and its
    04:51
    colonies and the colonists will
    04:53
    eventually try to get around this and
    04:55
    they will do so by smuggling the
    04:58
    dominion of New England could buy
    04:59
    Massachusetts with the rest of New
    05:00
    England and later New Jersey in New York
    05:02
    and this was a way for England to try to
    05:04
    gain more control over the colonies and
    05:07
    assemblies were eliminated and a new
    05:09
    governor was appointed Sir Edmund Andros
    05:12
    he was incredibly unpopular he
    05:14
    eventually is going to be overthrown
    05:16
    he's going to try to escape America by
    05:18
    dressing as a woman but he is caught so
    05:21
    these are different attempts of britain
    05:24
    tried to increase control of its
    05:26
    colonies via mercantilism colonial
    05:29
    resistance to the British stemmed from a
    05:31
    bunch of different ideas including
    05:33
    colonial self-government the idea the
    05:35
    colonists mostly white land owning men
    05:37
    in most cases were able to vote for
    05:39
    colonial represent representatives
    05:41
    however they had no say in Parliament so
    05:44
    colonists could not vote for members of
    05:46
    parliament ideas of Liberty again from
    05:48
    the Enlightenment time period these
    05:50
    ideas are very popular in colonists all
    05:52
    themselves as British and wanted the
    05:54
    same rights as their British
    05:55
    counterparts the Enlightenment
    05:57
    challenged traditional ideas of
    05:58
    government this would encourage limiting
    06:00
    the power of government whether it's due
    06:02
    checks and balances or different ways of
    06:06
    limiting the power of a central
    06:08
    government religious independence and
    06:11
    diversity is also occurring in the first
    06:13
    Great Awakening challenge traditional
    06:15
    Church Authority and this would lead to
    06:17
    challenging of authority in other areas
    06:19
    as well especially the government so
    06:21
    some people argue the first Great
    06:22
    Awakening is kind of a forerunner to the
    06:25
    American Revolution
    06:26
    there's also perceived corruption in the
    06:29
    Imperial system or in the Imperial
    06:31
    government so corrupt rulers like Sir
    06:33
    Edmund Andros in the Dominion of England
    06:35
    that we just talked about he eliminated
    06:37
    colonial assembly so there's this idea
    06:39
    that you know maybe these peep
    06:41
    who are in charge in government are kind
    06:43
    of corrupted and don't have the colonial
    06:45
    best interests at heart and there is Sir
    06:49
    Edmund Andros kicad some 2.2 Roman
    06:52
    numeral - like other European empires in
    06:54
    the Americas that participate in the
    06:56
    Atlantic slave trade the English
    06:57
    colonies developed a system of slavery
    06:59
    that reflected the specific economic
    07:01
    demographic and geographic
    07:03
    characteristics of those colonies so why
    07:07
    did all the British colonies participate
    07:09
    in the slave trade to some degree it's
    07:10
    not just the south initially that
    07:12
    participates there's large amounts of
    07:14
    farmland everywhere and there's a high
    07:16
    demand in Europe for colonial Goods
    07:19
    again tobacco I can't stress enough how
    07:20
    important tobacco was there was a very
    07:22
    large market for it an opportunity for
    07:25
    people to make lots of money there's
    07:26
    also a shortage of a duchard servants
    07:28
    especially after Bacon's Rebellion in
    07:31
    1676 and that's really going to make
    07:34
    many plantation owners want a more
    07:37
    permanent source of labour so where was
    07:40
    slavery found in the British colonies I
    07:41
    just mentioned it was found pretty much
    07:43
    everywhere well in New England small
    07:45
    farms had some slaves port cities and
    07:48
    the north and the south would have
    07:49
    slaves that would be working so any
    07:51
    cities that were involved heavily in
    07:52
    trade and plantations especially in the
    07:55
    Chesapeake which is Maryland in Virginia
    07:57
    don't forget and the south areas like
    07:59
    North Carolina South Carolina and
    08:01
    Georgia now most of the slaves were
    08:04
    living in the south but they were but
    08:06
    there were some in all the British
    08:09
    colonies and most African slaves were
    08:11
    sent to the Caribbean to the West Indies
    08:14
    to work on sugar plantations so what's
    08:18
    the impact of slavery in the south while
    08:20
    we have the emergence of a strict racial
    08:22
    system there's prohibition of
    08:24
    interracial interracial relationships
    08:26
    again you can contrast that with the
    08:28
    Spanish colonies where the British did
    08:30
    not really allow interracial
    08:32
    relationships whereas the Spanish
    08:35
    colonies dead children are mothers at
    08:38
    were slaves were enslaved so it didn't
    08:39
    matter who the father was the mother was
    08:42
    a slave her children would automatically
    08:45
    be slave so that helped to find who
    08:47
    slaves were African's resisted slavery
    08:49
    and sought to maintain some levels of
    08:51
    autonomy again autonomy means like self
    08:54
    ruler and
    08:55
    and they did so through family culture
    08:57
    and religion we're also going to talk
    08:59
    about how Africans resisted slavery so
    09:01
    they did so overtly through rebellion a
    09:04
    famous rebellion in 1739 just outside of
    09:07
    Charleston South Carolina was a Stono
    09:09
    rebellion in which slaves revolted that
    09:12
    killed many whites and they tried to
    09:13
    flee to Spanish held Florida
    09:16
    they also rebelled or revolt resisted
    09:19
    slavery covertly doing things more
    09:21
    discreetly like breaking tools running
    09:23
    away working slowly faking illness and
    09:26
    Africans maintained levels of autonomy
    09:29
    by family structures that were created
    09:31
    like surrogate families for slaves that
    09:33
    were sold so they would have friends on
    09:36
    other plantations look after slaves that
    09:38
    were sold culture there's this emergence
    09:40
    of a new language and music music was
    09:44
    very influential very important for
    09:46
    slaves and religion that we would see
    09:48
    the emergence of new religions that
    09:50
    combined elements of African religions
    09:52
    with Christianity these are always the
    09:55
    African sought to maintain autonomy in
    09:58
    their situation all right so let's go
    10:01
    over to some test tips for multiple
    10:03
    choices short answer definitely know the
    10:05
    impact of the Elena in the first Great
    10:06
    Awakening what were the goals of
    10:08
    mercantilism and colonial economic goals
    10:11
    how did they differ reads us for the
    10:12
    growth of slavery and its impact for
    10:14
    essay questions definitely be familiar
    10:17
    with the reasons for the growth of
    10:18
    slavery and its impacts impact is well
    10:20
    including ways Africans resisted their
    10:23
    plight over their really tough
    10:25
    situations and change the continuity of
    10:27
    British Imperial control with relations
    10:30
    with the counties what we talked about
    10:31
    at the beginning of this video all right
    10:34
    when leave you with a short answer
    10:35
    question the late 17th and early 18th
    10:37
    century saw a rise in African slave
    10:39
    labor in the British colonies a briefly
    10:42
    explained one reason for the rise of
    10:44

    Dutch colonization video for you today
    00:12
    this one is screaming to me a potential
    00:15
    essay topic or short answer question
    00:18
    topic so make sure you are familiar with
    00:21
    these European powers and their
    00:23
    colonization of the Americas alright so
    00:27
    let's start off this is a combination of
    00:28
    periods 1 & 2 now much of these periods
    00:32
    focus on European exploration and their
    00:35
    impact on the Americas and as I just
    00:37
    mentioned this is a great potential
    00:39
    short answer slash essay topic ap is
    00:43
    asked these questions before in the past
    00:45
    and it's and they could very well ask
    00:47
    them again on your test in May so some
    00:50
    big idea questions to think about while
    00:52
    we're similarities differences among the
    00:53
    European powers and what impacts it each
    00:56
    power have on North America and it's
    00:58
    inhibited to European exploration let's
    01:00
    talk about reasons for by the way if you
    01:02
    see words here that are bolded that
    01:04
    means it is mentioned in the curriculum
    01:05
    and you best know it so there are things
    01:09
    like wealth power and status and the
    01:11
    spread of Christianity or religion think
    01:14
    of the 3 G's gold glory and God those 3
    01:18
    G's are reasons why European countries
    01:20
    were exploring the Americas we have
    01:22
    technological improvements which allowed
    01:24
    them to explore things like the sextant
    01:26
    up here which was like its first which
    01:29
    was like a GPS for ships which allowed
    01:32
    them to determine exact location and
    01:34
    also the caravel a ship like this which
    01:37
    was developed by the Portuguese which
    01:39
    traveled much faster interactions when
    01:42
    natives during this time many or most
    01:44
    Europeans all natives as uncivilized
    01:46
    they would use terms like savages and
    01:48
    barbaric when describing Native
    01:50
    Americans and there were differences
    01:52
    over land ownership the idea that Native
    01:55
    Americans saw land is belonging to a
    01:57
    group of people or the community whereas
    01:59
    Europeans saw belonging to individuals
    02:01
    there's differences in family in
    02:03
    generals and also religion that led to
    02:05
    conflicts between European and natives
    02:08
    so there's this misunderstanding of each
    02:10
    group
    02:10
    by the other so it's sort of a Spanish
    02:13
    colonization everything read that's
    02:14
    where Spain was Spain became the early
    02:18
    European leader in exploration and they
    02:20
    tend to settle in South America and the
    02:22
    southwestern portion of the United
    02:23
    States that's why if you travel to Latin
    02:25
    America they speak Spanish Spain sots
    02:29
    precious metals things like gold and
    02:31
    silver and they sought to acquire these
    02:33
    from mines we have Spanish conquistadors
    02:36
    people like Hernan Cortes who conquered
    02:38
    1000 chitlin which was the present-day
    02:41
    Mexico City in 1519 and he conquered the
    02:44
    Aztecs due to advanced weapons and
    02:47
    disease Native Americans were not immune
    02:50
    to European diseases Francisco Pizarro
    02:52
    conquered the Incas in Peru and then
    02:54
    with the emergence of the Columbian
    02:55
    Exchange which is which is the transfer
    02:57
    of goods people people's ideas and
    03:00
    diseases across the Atlantic so what are
    03:03
    the impacts on the Americas holy cow no
    03:05
    this the impacts of the Colombia
    03:07
    exchange on America on the Americas and
    03:10
    on Europe on the America as we see
    03:12
    disease decreased native populations
    03:14
    drastically as maize 90% in some areas
    03:17
    died and the livestock and guns altered
    03:20
    hunting and warfare especially for
    03:22
    Native Americans living on the Great
    03:24
    Plains the introduction of things like
    03:25
    horses transformed native life what's
    03:28
    the impact on Europe well new crops
    03:30
    things like potatoes and maize increase
    03:33
    the population of Europe drastically
    03:36
    this increased wealth led to capitalism
    03:39
    the emergence of capitalism and the
    03:41
    decline of feudalism Spanish colonial
    03:44
    societies we're going to talk about now
    03:45
    Spain really sought tight control from
    03:48
    the crown they were very active in the
    03:50
    colonies and they wanted to convert many
    03:52
    natives again that idea of God with the
    03:55
    3gs
    03:56
    most Spanish settlers were men leading
    03:58
    to racially mixed populations with
    04:00
    natives we have the emergence of a caste
    04:03
    system which included mestizos which
    04:06
    were people of mixed Spanish and native
    04:08
    ancestry this is a very key point
    04:11
    Spanish men tended to intermarry with
    04:13
    Native Americans we'll see that's not at
    04:16
    all what happens with the English
    04:18
    there's a good contrasting point for the
    04:21
    two European country
    04:23
    mulattos were also part of the caste
    04:26
    system these were people that were mixed
    04:28
    Spanish and African ancestry the in
    04:30
    comiendo system developed which were
    04:33
    royal land grants of Spanish settlers
    04:35
    and the Spanish settlers promised to
    04:37
    Christianize natives on the land and
    04:38
    they would gain tribute from the natives
    04:40
    in other words it was simply slavery for
    04:43
    Native Americans I have a detailed video
    04:46
    on the communist system check it out in
    04:47
    the description below
    04:49
    eventually the in command system is
    04:51
    going to be replaced by African slave
    04:54
    labor there were debates that emerged
    04:57
    over how natives should be treated we
    04:59
    see the emergence of two people in
    05:00
    particular Wanda Sepulveda he argued the
    05:03
    harsh treatment of natives was justified
    05:05
    and this guy Bartone de las casas he
    05:08
    advocated her favored better treatment
    05:11
    of natives and his writings really
    05:13
    helped lead to the decline of encomienda
    05:15
    system he was very critical Spain and
    05:17
    his writings introduced the idea of the
    05:19
    black legend this idea that Spain was a
    05:22
    brutal colonizer that exploited natives
    05:25
    and he really brought a lot of attention
    05:26
    to the plight of Native Americans the
    05:29
    Pueblo Revolt occurred in 1680 in the
    05:32
    southwestern portion of the United
    05:34
    States the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico
    05:37
    they successfully overthrew the Spanish
    05:39
    for about a dozen years now the Spanish
    05:42
    do regain control but as a result they
    05:44
    are much more accommodating of native
    05:47
    culture they were less restrictive of
    05:48
    their practices especially religious
    05:51
    practices alright let's jump on over to
    05:53
    English colonization first permanent
    05:56
    settlement was in Jamestown in 1607 and
    05:59
    here is Jamestown you can go and visit
    06:01
    it today
    06:01
    in Virginia set along the Atlantic and
    06:04
    the present-day US and Caribbean and
    06:06
    applied many of the same tactics used in
    06:08
    Ireland towards natives now before the
    06:10
    English colonized America they took over
    06:14
    Ireland and they treated the Irish very
    06:16
    harsh and they basically looked at them
    06:18
    as a separate group of people they
    06:21
    basically sought to dominate the Irish
    06:23
    they the natives were seen as savages
    06:26
    and they were excluded from English
    06:28
    settlement so unlike the Spanish or the
    06:30
    French which we'll see which they have
    06:32
    you know they're living amongst the
    06:33
    natives that does not happen with
    06:35
    English
    06:36
    again that's another good contrasting
    06:39
    point England sent large amounts of men
    06:41
    and women to the colonies unlike the
    06:44
    French in Spanish which sent relatively
    06:46
    few numbers of men the English sent a
    06:49
    lot of people that were both men and
    06:50
    women they focus on agriculture and they
    06:53
    had hostile relationships or conflicts
    06:55
    with the natives there's more info free
    06:58
    or contrasting paragraph let's talk
    07:00
    about the different colonies while in
    07:02
    New England colonies like Massachusetts
    07:04
    and Rhode Island they were founded
    07:05
    Massachusetts by Puritans they sought to
    07:08
    establish a community of like-minded
    07:09
    believers this dude John Winthrop gave a
    07:13
    famous speech where he talked about
    07:14
    Massachusetts being a city upon a hill a
    07:17
    model Society for all of the world to
    07:19
    look up to and they really focused in
    07:22
    New England on agriculture and commerce
    07:25
    it was a mixed economy those that were
    07:28
    not like-minded be hit believers were
    07:30
    outcasts people like Roger Williams and
    07:32
    Anne Hutchinson which challenged Puritan
    07:34
    doctrines they were kicked out of the
    07:37
    colony the middle colonies were going to
    07:39
    jump on over to colonies like
    07:40
    Pennsylvania New York they were the most
    07:43
    diverse religiously ethnically and
    07:45
    demographically of the English colony so
    07:48
    you see people that are not just from
    07:49
    England emigrating to the middle
    07:52
    colonies but other countries like
    07:53
    Germany as what is present-day Germany
    07:55
    as well many immigrants from Europe came
    07:58
    to these counties they were religiously
    08:00
    tolerant Pennsylvania was founded by
    08:02
    this dude William Penn who saw it as a
    08:03
    holy experiment where it would be
    08:05
    religiously tolerant II hope to make
    08:07
    money the southern colonies which
    08:10
    include the Chesapeake Maryland of
    08:12
    Virginia North Carolina those three
    08:14
    focus on tobacco which was a niche and
    08:16
    they initially used indentured servants
    08:18
    and later African slavery after Bacon's
    08:22
    Rebellion witch plantation owners moved
    08:25
    from a temporary labor supply of
    08:27
    indentured servants to a permanent one
    08:29
    of African slaves South Carolina in the
    08:31
    West Indies they focused on rice and
    08:33
    sugar cultivation and slaves made up
    08:35
    most of the population it was very hot
    08:38
    very humid and very arduous work for
    08:41
    these slaves then the colonies had some
    08:44
    form of representative assembly New
    08:47
    England had the town hall meetings
    08:50
    Virginia had the Virginia House of
    08:52
    Burgesses right England promoted this
    08:55
    idea of mercantilism the idea that the
    08:57
    counties existed for the benefit of the
    08:59
    mother country and the purpose was to
    09:01
    provide raw materials and markets for
    09:03
    England they focus on controlling a
    09:05
    balance of trade the more gold and
    09:07
    silver that flew into the country the
    09:10
    better and more wealthy that country
    09:12
    would become the Navigation Acts were
    09:15
    created that allowed for counties to
    09:16
    trade only with England so if you're
    09:18
    living in Massachusetts for example
    09:20
    you're expected to only trade with
    09:23
    England and many colonists resisted
    09:26
    these acts and they smuggle this will be
    09:28
    a common theme pre 1776 that colonies
    09:32
    will smuggle to get around these laws
    09:33
    rights jump on over to French
    09:35
    colonization we see here the Louisiana
    09:37
    Purchase and much of Canada is where the
    09:40
    French were focused so samuel de
    09:42
    champlain found in Quebec in 1608 one
    09:45
    year after Jamestown most of the
    09:46
    colonists were men again unlike the
    09:49
    English who were men and women like
    09:52
    Spain France accepted intermarriage
    09:54
    Maties were children of French and
    09:57
    native ancestry and they really the
    10:00
    French really focus on fur trade with
    10:01
    natives they developed friendly
    10:03
    relations with natives cordoba were
    10:06
    these French fur traders they were
    10:08
    called runners of the woods and knew
    10:09
    France had a governor-general that that
    10:12
    ruled it was appointed in Paris so like
    10:14
    Spain the crown kind of had tight
    10:17
    control over this there was no
    10:19
    representative assembly like there was
    10:21
    in the English colonies so let's talk
    10:24
    about relations with natives they did
    10:26
    not take a substantial amount of native
    10:27
    land like the English did and they did
    10:30
    not force them into slavery like the
    10:32
    Spanish so the French really had the
    10:33
    best relationship with natives out of
    10:35
    those three Christian Indians were
    10:37
    allowed to have a lot of autonomy again
    10:39
    that word autonomy or independence and
    10:42
    many natives were killed by diseases
    10:45
    just like they were by the Spanish and
    10:47
    the English alright we'll finish up a
    10:49
    Dutch colonization we have Henry Hudson
    10:51
    of the Dutch East India Company he
    10:53
    reached New York in 1609 the Dutch
    10:55
    established trade post in New York and
    10:57
    present-day Manhattan and Albany and
    11:00
    like the French the Dutch set few
    11:02
    Europeans to settle and they formed a
    11:04
    lion
    11:04
    says and intermarried with the native so
    11:06
    three of the four European countries who
    11:09
    talked about intermarried with the
    11:11
    natives it's the English that did not
    11:13
    the Dutch created the idea of the joint
    11:15
    stock company which is a forerunner to
    11:17
    the present-day corporation and this is
    11:19
    where people would pool their money
    11:20
    together and they would share in the
    11:22
    profits and losses of voyages again we
    11:25
    talked about that with Jamestown the
    11:27
    establishment of Jamestown by the
    11:29
    English that was created to join stock
    11:31
    company by the Dutch New Netherland they
    11:34
    dominated the Atlantic slave trade early
    11:37
    on and married women retained rights
    11:39
    when married unlike English women who
    11:42
    lost their land if you were an English
    11:44
    woman and you were single and you won't
    11:47
    land and you got married you would lose
    11:48
    that land it would go to your husband
    11:51
    there was some religious toleration
    11:53
    although it was done privately not
    11:55
    publicly behind in your home you could
    11:58
    practice whatever religion you really
    11:59
    wanted to but you couldn't do it
    12:00
    publicly all right some test steps for
    12:03
    multiple choice and short answer reasons
    12:04
    for European exploration whether it's
    12:06
    the three GS or technology
    12:07
    characteristics of European colonies
    12:09
    know the characteristics of the British
    12:11
    colonies the New England ones the middle
    12:13
    and the southern the impacts of contact
    12:16
    on natives and Europeans the Columbian
    12:18
    Exchange that is just screaming to me a
    12:20
    short answer question and four essays
    12:22
    comparing and contrasting
    12:23
    characteristics and goals that was a
    12:25
    summer essay for my students some things
    12:28
    to keep in mind the British sent a large
    12:30
    number of men and women I've said this
    12:32
    so many times I hope you remember this
    12:33
    they also focus on agriculture and
    12:35
    they'd hostile relations with natives
    12:37
    the French said fewer Europeans and they
    12:39
    focus on trade alliances with natives
    12:41
    now that oh so important synthesis point
    12:44
    which could make or break an essay a way
    12:47
    to achieve this if the essay does not
    12:49
    tell you to you could divide it up into
    12:51
    political social and economic categories
    12:54
    now the easier way I believe is the
    12:57
    connected to another time period but you
    12:59
    can't just mention it you have to
    13:01
    explain it so for example you could say
    13:04
    you could write something like this the
    13:06
    arguments used by Europeans to justify
    13:08
    colonization included spreading
    13:10
    Christianity this is a similar argument
    13:12
    that was used by some Americans that
    13:14
    sought to spread Christianity in Asia in
    13:16
    the late 1930s
    13:18
    20 centuries after the u.s. acquired
    13:20
    land in the spanish-american war so I'm
    13:22
    not just naming another time period I'm
    13:24
    not just connecting it I'm explaining
    13:26
    how it's similar a lot of students have
    13:28
    no problem connecting the explanation is
    13:30
    where many students lose points but
    13:32
    that's not going to be you because you
    13:34
    know what to do all right guys thank you

    00:00
    hey what's up a push people today we
    00:02
    have the Enlightenment for you a topic
    00:04
    that is specifically mentioned in the
    00:06
    new curriculum and has an instrumental
    00:09
    role in the development of the United
    00:11
    States so definitely be familiar with
    00:12
    this topic for the new push curriculum
    00:15
    so let's take a look exactly at the new
    00:16
    a.push curricula in their way bit key
    00:18
    concept two point three Roman numeral I
    00:20
    letter B several factors promoted and
    00:23
    glekas ation in the British colonies the
    00:25
    growth of the autonomous political
    00:27
    communities based on English models the
    00:29
    development of commercial ties and legal
    00:31
    structures the emergence of
    00:33
    transatlantic print culture Protestant
    00:35
    evangelism religious toleration and the
    00:37
    spread of European enlightenment I DEA's
    00:41
    so definitely be familiar with the fact
    00:43
    that the layman had tremendous had a
    00:44
    tremendous tremendous impact on American
    00:47
    and the world politics and society and
    00:50
    again like everything that you see in
    00:52
    that curriculum that specifically
    00:54
    mentioned in the white area make sure
    00:55
    you are familiar with it that it's fair
    00:57
    game for the test that you are expected
    00:59
    to know without a prompt whatsoever
    01:01
    alright let's go over some background
    01:03
    info what the heck is the Enlightenment
    01:05
    well is a movement that believed that
    01:07
    reason and knowledge could lead to
    01:09
    progress and advancements in society so
    01:12
    when exactly did this occur it was in
    01:14
    the 17th and 18th centuries and it
    01:17
    originated in Europe so what is the
    01:19
    impact of it well a helped challenged
    01:21
    traditional Authority especially
    01:23
    government and monarchies in this idea
    01:26
    that maybe monarchies and leaders with
    01:28
    all this power wasn't the best way for
    01:30
    government to be run all right some key
    01:33
    Enlightenment thinkers that you should
    01:34
    be familiar with the first guy up is
    01:36
    john locke arguably the most famous one
    01:38
    he is a reading called the two treatises
    01:40
    of government and he laid forth this
    01:43
    belief in natural rights and there are
    01:45
    three natural rights that all people are
    01:47
    born with life liberty and property that
    01:49
    sounds familiar
    01:50
    because thomas jefferson took that and
    01:52
    changed property to the pursuit of
    01:54
    happiness in the Declaration of
    01:56
    Independence he also believed in this
    01:58
    idea of the consent of the governed and
    02:00
    consent means you are giving your
    02:02
    permission so the permission of those
    02:05
    that are governed what exactly does that
    02:07
    mean it means that the government or the
    02:09
    leaders rule with the people's
    02:11
    permission in other words
    02:13
    like them to run the government on their
    02:16
    behalf and in a very worst-case scenario
    02:19
    that people can overthrow the government
    02:20
    if necessary they can certainly at least
    02:22
    vote them out of office that's what he
    02:24
    meant by the consent of the governed and
    02:25
    these ideas were influential in the
    02:28
    Declaration of Independence next up we
    02:31
    have Baron de Montesquieu and he wrote
    02:33
    the spirit of laws and he advocated
    02:36
    checks and balances and separation of
    02:38
    powers in other words dividing power
    02:40
    among branches would help prevent
    02:43
    government abuse and we see this in our
    02:45
    government today with three separate
    02:47
    government branches we have the
    02:49
    legislative branch which makes laws the
    02:51
    executive branch which enforces laws and
    02:53
    the judicial branch which determines
    02:55
    whether or not these laws are
    02:56
    constitutional this idea is in part
    03:00
    thanks to Beryl de Montesquieu Thomas
    03:02
    Paine or t-pain was a British born
    03:05
    individual who later moved to the United
    03:08
    States and he wrote Common Sense and he
    03:10
    advocated that the u.s. declare
    03:13
    independence from England he wrote that
    03:14
    in January 1776 it was one of the
    03:17
    best-selling pamphlets at that time and
    03:21
    just like John Locke Thomas Paine helped
    03:24
    influence the Declaration of
    03:25
    Independence so let's talk about some
    03:27
    key ideas that are seen in the US
    03:28
    government as a result of the
    03:31
    Enlightenment again as I mentioned
    03:32
    before we have the three branches of
    03:33
    government we also have freedom of
    03:35
    speech which was this idea introduced by
    03:36
    another Enlightenment thinker Voltaire
    03:38
    and the ideas which encourage
    03:40
    individuals to challenge authority in
    03:42
    unjust government helped inspire the
    03:45
    American Revolution so again these ideas
    03:47
    of those Enlightenment thinkers really
    03:49
    made colonists feel you know why our
    03:51
    government is not serving us properly we
    03:54
    should overthrow that government and
    03:56
    Enlightenment ideas we're seen in other
    03:58
    revolutions as well not just the
    04:00
    American Revolution we have the French
    04:02
    Revolution in 1789 and we have Latin
    04:05
    American revolutions as well people like
    04:07
    Simona Bolivar who plays a huge role in
    04:09
    a lot of Latin American countries
    04:12
    gaining independence from Spain all
    04:15
    right some test steps for the
    04:16
    Enlightenment multiple choice and short
    04:17
    answer questions they may give you an
    04:20
    excerpt of a reading maybe it's a job
    04:22
    lock maybe it's a Montesquieu and just
    04:24
    know what those impacts are be able to
    04:26
    explain them
    04:27
    short answer be able to identify and
    04:29
    describe enlightenment thinkers and
    04:31
    their impacts perhaps you'd have to
    04:32
    choose one or two of them and for essay
    04:36
    questions think about the causes of the
    04:38
    American Revolution and how exactly did
    04:40
    the Enlightenment fit into the causes of
    04:42
    the American Revolution
    04:44
    all right that's everything you guys
    04:46
    need to know about the Enlightenment I
    04:48

    what's going on a push piece we have a
    00:01
    good one for you today this one is on
    00:03
    the Chesapeake colonies part of the
    00:05
    southern region of the British thirteen
    00:08
    colonies before I begin it is shout out
    00:10
    time I want to give a shout outs to mr.
    00:12
    Roush his class at goshi High School and
    00:14
    in a push class that is watching in
    00:17
    Bermuda thank you all so much for your
    00:19
    support I appreciate best of luck it
    00:21
    will do awesome on this exam all right
    00:25
    let's do a brief intro of the Chesapeake
    00:27
    colonies what are those two colonies
    00:29
    think about it you know it yeah you're
    00:31
    right look at you little genius it is
    00:33
    Maryland and Virginia named because of
    00:36
    the Chesapeake Bay try speaking economy
    00:39
    so we see predominantly agriculture and
    00:41
    lots of rural sediments with plantations
    00:44
    many of these plantations are gonna go
    00:47
    grow crash crop cash crops specifically
    00:50
    tobacco it will make lots and lots of
    00:53
    money early on in the history we see the
    00:55
    huge influx of indentured servants who
    00:57
    are working these are people who had
    00:59
    their passage paid to the Americas in
    01:01
    exchange for working usually about four
    01:03
    to five years but that's gonna
    01:05
    drastically decline the number of
    01:07
    indentured servants after 1676 because
    01:10
    of Bacon's Rebellion in Jamestown a lot
    01:13
    of poor landless White's rebelled and
    01:17
    burned down the town so what is the
    01:18
    impact of that well we'll see a growth
    01:20
    of slavery and the head right system is
    01:23
    going to benefit wealthy landowners this
    01:26
    would provide additional acres of land
    01:28
    usually about 50 to individuals who paid
    01:31
    for the passage of an indentured servant
    01:33
    and again after 1676 we really see a
    01:37
    decline in indentured servitude and in
    01:40
    addressing increase in African slave
    01:43
    labor for demographics again talking
    01:45
    about the makeup of the counties people
    01:47
    etc we see some families some extended
    01:50
    families but many white male indentured
    01:53
    servants early on we also have a lower
    01:55
    life expectancy than new england and the
    01:57
    middle counties it's much warmer their
    01:59
    diseases are spreading and many people
    02:02
    died at 20 do you have any idea what
    02:03
    that means that means I'd be dead for a
    02:06
    very long time but more importantly it
    02:07
    means that people were having midlife
    02:09
    crises at 10 can you believe that that's
    02:12
    insane
    02:13
    all right Chesapeake politics usually
    02:15
    people jump right to the Virginia House
    02:17
    of Burgesses located in Jamestown and
    02:21
    also Williamsburg Virginia it was
    02:23
    actually located both places and they
    02:25
    switched 1619 the Virginia House of
    02:27
    Burgesses was established as the first
    02:30
    representative assembly in the American
    02:33
    British colonies the governor of
    02:36
    Virginia was appointed by England and
    02:37
    worked with the Virginia House of
    02:39
    Burgesses voting requirements did change
    02:42
    over time but most consistently it was
    02:45
    limited to land owning men and later
    02:48
    housekeepers or heads of household even
    02:50
    if they didn't necessarily own land if
    02:51
    they were renters or something instead
    02:53
    and this really was a small group of
    02:56
    people one it's men to their white men
    02:58
    in theory it's really wealthy men as
    03:00
    well and the elite wealthy planters
    03:03
    dominated politics and in turn will make
    03:06
    laws that favor them that's why we'll
    03:08
    see things like the head right system
    03:09
    emerge and slave codes as well religion
    03:13
    in the Chesapeake most people think of
    03:15
    the Maryland acts of toleration which
    03:17
    were created in Maryland which was
    03:19
    founded by Lord Baltimore the second
    03:21
    here is good old Lord Baltimore this
    03:24
    granted religious freedom but only to
    03:27
    Christians this was specifically aimed
    03:29
    at protecting Catholics Maryland was
    03:32
    founded as kind of a safe haven for
    03:34
    Catholics and there was fear that they
    03:36
    would be outnumbered by Protestants so
    03:38
    the Maryland of that acts of toleration
    03:40
    were passed to assure religious
    03:43
    toleration to all Christians but they
    03:45
    did not extend that to other religions
    03:48
    beyond Christianity has tips we'll
    03:50
    finish up with today for multiple choice
    03:52
    and short answer be able to compare
    03:54
    contrast this with other regions and for
    03:56
    essays same thing
    03:58
    comparing as well whether it is politics
    04:02
    or the formation or the impact of
    04:04
    religion or economics or anything like

    countries thank you for your support I
    00:26
    appreciate it all right let's do a brief
    00:28
    intro the New England colonies consisted
    00:31
    of Massachusetts Rhode Island
    00:32
    Connecticut and New Hampshire most
    00:35
    people when they think of the New
    00:36
    England colonies think of Massachusetts
    00:38
    that's your John Winthrop and those
    00:40
    Puritans alright let's talk about the
    00:43
    New England economy and it really
    00:45
    consisted of small towns and family
    00:48
    farms not plantations like the south the
    00:51
    geography and the climate did not favor
    00:54
    large-scale farms and plantations in New
    00:57
    England like they did in the south we
    00:59
    also have a mixed economy of Agriculture
    01:01
    and commerce including merchants ship
    01:04
    bale building whaling etc so lots of
    01:07
    different commerce was occurring in New
    01:10
    England and slavery did exist many
    01:13
    people think that slavery was confined
    01:14
    only to the southern colonies that is
    01:16
    not true it did exist in the New England
    01:19
    colonies it was just on a smaller scale
    01:22
    right the New England demographics
    01:25
    talking about the makeup of the people
    01:27
    you were more likely to see families
    01:28
    than other regions living close together
    01:31
    and grandparents too and here's a
    01:33
    grandparent with his grandchild and
    01:35
    there were higher life expectancies than
    01:37
    other regions that is why you were more
    01:40
    likely see grandparents in New England
    01:42
    the weather was cooler so diseases
    01:44
    didn't spread as easily New England
    01:47
    politics made people think in the town
    01:49
    hall meetings where the community would
    01:52
    gather and pretty much anybody could go
    01:54
    to the town hall meetings but in order
    01:55
    to vote in the town hall meetings would
    01:57
    to be a member of the church would to be
    01:59
    white and a land owning mail so a
    02:01
    significantly small portion of the
    02:04
    population was able to vote most people
    02:07
    were not able to vote members of the
    02:09
    community as I mentioned could attend
    02:11
    but they could not vote in they could
    02:12
    not speak
    02:13
    at these meetings so when you watch
    02:15
    presidential debates or presidential
    02:17
    elections you hear this town hall
    02:18
    meeting where people gather and kind of
    02:20
    ask questions to the candidates that has
    02:22
    its roots traced all the way back to the
    02:24
    New England Town Hall meaning this is an
    02:27
    early form of democracy although again
    02:29
    it's very limited the amount of people
    02:31
    that are able to participate in this
    02:33
    democracy it is an early form of
    02:35
    democracy in American history so about
    02:37
    religion in New England
    02:39
    Massachusetts was dominated by Puritans
    02:41
    it was really founded by them John
    02:43
    Winthrop in his famous city upon a hill
    02:45
    speech if you want a video that breaks
    02:48
    that down a quick video lesson for
    02:50
    minutes check it out in the description
    02:51
    they were not religiously tolerant so if
    02:54
    you did not follow in adhere to the
    02:57
    Puritan lifestyle you would encounter
    02:59
    challenges and difficulties and could
    03:00
    even be exiled like Roger Williams was
    03:03
    to Rhode Island which he helped found so
    03:06
    here is Roger Williams he was kicked out
    03:08
    for challenging the clergy along with
    03:10
    Anne Hutchinson and he established Rhode
    03:12
    Island where we see separation of church
    03:14
    and state and religious freedom he also
    03:17
    treated Native Americans pretty well he
    03:19
    wanted to pay them for the land that
    03:21
    they lost so Roger Williams and John
    03:23
    Winthrop they used to be boys they used
    03:25
    to be pretty close but they butted heads
    03:27
    John Winthrop who was a many time
    03:28
    governor said you know what Roger you
    03:30
    got to get out of here you're
    03:31
    challenging the Puritan church too much
    03:34
    all right some test tips for you for
    03:36
    multiple choices short answer definitely
    03:38
    know how religion affected the
    03:39
    development of New England be able to
    03:42
    compare and contrast this region with
    03:44
    other regions and for essays
    03:46
    specifically I could see one on
    03:48
    comparing with other regions especially
    03:51
    the influence of religion and the
    03:53
    economy so thank you guys very much for
    03:56
    watching I appreciate it best of luck on
    03:57
    all your tests and have a good day

    00:03
    hey push people we have another edition
    00:06
    for you today this one is on meta comms
    00:08
    or King Philip's War and this is
    00:10
    specifically mentioned in the revised
    00:12
    editions this is one of several examples
    00:15
    of conflicts between Native Americans
    00:17
    and colonists in period two so make sure
    00:20
    you are familiar with this video at the
    00:22
    end we got a practice short answer
    00:24
    question for you alright so let's take a
    00:27
    look and see what it says key concept
    00:28
    two point one Roman numeral three letter
    00:30
    e British conflicts and American Indians
    00:32
    over land resources and political
    00:34
    boundaries led to military confrontation
    00:37
    such as meta comms war also known as
    00:39
    King Philip's War and we'll talk about
    00:41
    why in New England so the causes are
    00:44
    listed for you there it's pretty much
    00:46
    over land and resources alright so key
    00:49
    ideas before the war we have a Native
    00:51
    American name ssy he was the leader of
    00:54
    the Wampanoag Indians and he maintained
    00:57
    peace with the New Englanders and we're
    00:59
    gonna focus this video focuses on the
    01:01
    Wampanoag Indians and here is masa SWA
    01:05
    down here interacting with various
    01:09
    colonists from New England on a sidenote
    01:12
    another Native American from this tribe
    01:14
    was instrumental in teaching New
    01:16
    Englanders how to farm especially when
    01:20
    it comes to corn so they had positive
    01:22
    relations early on with each other and
    01:25
    we'll see why that kind of falls apart
    01:27
    now
    01:27
    masses was son Medicom he was called
    01:30
    King Philip by the countess that was
    01:32
    kind of his English name so it is the
    01:34
    exact same person when you see Medicom
    01:36
    that is also King Philip don't be
    01:39
    confused by that police he becomes chief
    01:42
    in 1662 so like his father he saw to
    01:46
    continue living in harmony with the
    01:48
    colonists and getting along with them
    01:50
    however colonial encroachment everybody
    01:53
    right now makes sure you know this word
    01:55
    encroachment my students please circle
    01:57
    this for me encroachment very important
    02:00
    word you can use it in short answer
    02:01
    questions or writing that will really
    02:03
    strengthen your writing it means to come
    02:05
    on to somebody's land so the colonists
    02:08
    are coming on to the land of these
    02:10
    Native America
    02:11
    including colonists from Plymouth now
    02:14
    Metacom in the natives they're not going
    02:16
    to like this they're gonna want to keep
    02:18
    some of their autonomy and keep the
    02:20
    colonists from encroaching on their land
    02:22
    by the mid 1670s natives were vastly
    02:26
    outnumbered by the colonists 50,000 to
    02:29
    20,000 so the war begins in 1675 when
    02:33
    three Wampanoag Native Americans were
    02:36
    hanged in Plymouth Metacom he allied
    02:38
    himself with neighboring tribes and they
    02:41
    attacked towns in New England and here
    02:43
    you see an early painting of this war
    02:46
    initially Metacom in the Native
    02:48
    Americans were successful and colonists
    02:50
    were pushed far back towards the east
    02:52
    coast towards the Atlantic Ocean
    02:54
    however colonists soon turned the tide
    02:59
    and they sided with the Iroquois Indians
    03:01
    who provided vital aid to the colonists
    03:04
    and eventually defeating the Wampanoag
    03:07
    Indians and this 8 that their
    03:10
    acquaintance provided actually developed
    03:13
    into an alliance in New York and we'll
    03:15
    talk more about the Iroquois when we get
    03:16
    to the French and Indian War so what our
    03:18
    effects of the war wants 1678 the war
    03:21
    ended Metacom was captured and killed
    03:23
    and here is a picture you can actually
    03:25
    go to the site where Medicom was
    03:28
    captured I would like to go there
    03:29
    someday and colonists retaliated by
    03:32
    destroying Native villages so there was
    03:35
    lots of villages on both sides and
    03:39
    dwellings that were destroyed and many
    03:41
    Native men women and children were
    03:44
    either killed or were sold into slavery
    03:46
    in the West Indies including Metta coms
    03:49
    wife and sons so for many Native
    03:52
    American life drastically changed after
    03:55
    the war so what's the significance of it
    03:57
    while the war reinforced the image of
    03:59
    natives being seen as savages in the
    04:01
    eyes of many colonists and here is a
    04:04
    painting of Medicom from the 1700s that
    04:09
    kind of reinforces this image and Native
    04:12
    American resistance decrease in New
    04:14
    England this is very important to know
    04:15
    this is really one of the last instances
    04:18
    of major resistance against New
    04:22
    Englanders by Native Americans
    04:24
    and countess continued to expand on
    04:26
    native land after the war so this common
    04:29
    theme of encroachment on land will
    04:30
    continue after this war so some test
    04:33
    steps to finish up for multiple choice
    04:35
    and short answer definitely know the
    04:36
    causes and impacts and try to connect
    04:38
    this result to another time period maybe
    04:41
    you'll see a question about it
    04:42
    connecting it to another time period or
    04:44
    battle for a Native Americans for essay
    04:46
    questions you'll never see one about
    04:48
    meta comms war but you will what you
    04:50
    could likely see one about European
    04:52
    colonial relations with native so you
    04:55
    could tie this in for the synthesis
    04:57
    point you could connect this to another
    04:59
    time period for example after the Battle
    05:02
    of Wounded Knee in which the natives
    05:03
    lost in 1890 there was little resistance
    05:06
    to the American government afterwards
    05:08
    and they were no longer significant
    05:10
    military threat just like the Wampanoag
    05:13
    Indians were no longer a threat to New
    05:17
    England colonists alright your short
    05:19
    answer question meta comms king philip's
    05:21
    war was when the bloodiest wars between
    05:23
    Native Americans and New England
    05:24
    colonists a briefly explained one cause
    05:27
    of meta comms or King Philip's War be

    briefly explained one short term impact
    05:31
    of the war see briefly explained one
    05:34
    long term impact of the war and remember
    05:37
    you must have two to three sentences per

    your teacher just leave it in the
    00:35
    comment section below alright let's take
    00:37
    a look at three point one it says
    00:38
    British attempts to assert tighter
    00:40
    control over its North American colonies
    00:43
    and the colonial resolve to pursue
    00:45
    self-government led to a colonial
    00:47
    independence movement in the
    00:49
    Revolutionary War so we're really going
    00:50
    to focus on the causes of the
    00:52
    Revolutionary War here some big idea
    00:54
    questions how did this 7 Years War alter
    00:57
    the relationship between the British and
    00:59
    colonists and what arguments the
    01:01
    colonist used to resist Bryn's actions
    01:03
    after the war let's take a look at Roman
    01:07
    numeral 1 the competition among the
    01:09
    British French and American Indians for
    01:11
    economic and political advantage in
    01:13
    North America culminated in the Seven
    01:15
    Years War also known as the French and
    01:17
    Indian War in which Britain defeated
    01:19
    France and allied American Indians and
    01:22
    that's straight from page 36 if you
    01:24
    don't have this curriculum what are you
    01:26
    waiting for downloaded check the
    01:27
    description there is a link there so
    01:29
    let's talk about what led to the British
    01:31
    French conflict and what were the
    01:33
    impacts what without a doubt some causes
    01:36
    are expansion it's all over land
    01:39
    remember guys when it comes to colonial
    01:41
    wars it's going to be over land so the
    01:43
    British colonists are expanding and they
    01:45
    begin to go into the interior of North
    01:48
    America or the Ohio Valley day areas
    01:50
    like present-day western Pennsylvania
    01:53
    and Ohio and this will lead to conflicts
    01:55
    because that's where the French are set
    01:57
    up the Iroquois Native Americans they
    02:00
    were one of the few groups that allied
    02:02
    themselves with the British most other
    02:04
    Native Americans allied themselves with
    02:06
    the French and there is the Iroquois the
    02:09
    flag for the Iroquois Confederacy and as
    02:12
    a result of this
    02:13
    which ends in 1763 the British win and
    02:16
    the French are essentially removed from
    02:18
    North America and many Native Americans
    02:20
    as a result lose a valuable trading
    02:23
    partner a partner that they would trade
    02:25
    fur with and remember going back to
    02:27
    previous ideas the French had a really
    02:31
    good relationships with the native so
    02:34
    not only did the natives lose a trading
    02:35
    partner but they lost a very good Ally
    02:38
    and the British colonists began to
    02:40
    expand or encroach onto Native American
    02:43
    land and this will lead to Pontiacs
    02:46
    rebellion in 1763 which was a reaction
    02:49
    by Native Americans to resist colonial
    02:52
    encroachment and also the establishment
    02:55
    or the creation of the proclamation line
    02:57
    of 1763 by the British government which
    02:59
    forbid westward expansion past the
    03:02
    Appalachian Mountains so were some
    03:05
    impacts of the war well Britain gained
    03:07
    massive amounts of land in North America
    03:09
    again France is basically gone now with
    03:12
    that comes a cost and financial cost
    03:14
    that Britain is in debt from the war
    03:17
    their massive amounts of debt so the way
    03:19
    to get rid of this debt in Bryn's eyes
    03:21
    is to begin to tax colonists so they
    03:23
    sought to raise revenue and gain more
    03:26
    control over the colonies now this ends
    03:29
    a time period known as salutary neglect
    03:31
    in which Britain pretty much left the
    03:33
    colonies alone as long as they're making
    03:35
    money and not like roughly too many
    03:36
    feathers so that really comes to an end
    03:38
    and brain begins to tax the colonies now
    03:43
    some examples of taxes some major ones
    03:47
    with a Sugar Act in 1764 which was a tax
    03:50
    on sugar and the Stamp Act of 1765 which
    03:54
    you can see here by this picture was not
    03:55
    well liked by the colonists the Stamp
    03:57
    Act was a tax on 50 commonly used goods
    04:00
    such as newspapers playing cards
    04:03
    marriage licenses pretty much any legal
    04:06
    document or any paper with writing on it
    04:08
    was taxed and the colonists hated this
    04:11
    they did not like the idea of the
    04:12
    British taxing them so they formed the
    04:14
    Stamp Act Congress and eventually had it
    04:16
    repealed now tensions from the Seven
    04:19
    Years War this directly helped lead to
    04:21
    the American Revolution between 1763 and
    04:25
    1776 you
    04:26
    this massive shift in the relationship
    04:30
    between the British and the colonists if
    04:32
    you're looking for a really cool
    04:33
    assignment about different events and a
    04:36
    time line activity check the description
    04:38
    below to go to my website I have a
    04:39
    really cool activity it's not just the
    04:41
    timeline it's a point of view timeline
    04:43
    that will help you gain a better
    04:46
    understanding of this time period so
    04:50
    post Seven Years War Brin sought to
    04:52
    limit expansion we talked about with the
    04:54
    proclamation line of 1763 basically said
    04:57
    to Kahlan so you're not allowed to go
    04:58
    west of the Appalachian Mountains and
    05:00
    this was to avoid conflict with Native
    05:02
    Americans and natives would resist the
    05:05
    encroachment of the countess as we saw
    05:06
    in Pontiacs rebellion in 1763 all right
    05:10
    let's take a look at Roman numeral 2 the
    05:13
    desire of many colonists to assert
    05:14
    ideals of self-government in the face of
    05:16
    renewed British imperial efforts led to
    05:19
    a colonial independence movement and war
    05:21
    with Britain this is from page 37
    05:24
    so what United colonists against the
    05:27
    British again there's lots of colonial
    05:29
    unity throughout America the colonial
    05:31
    American history but this is really the
    05:32
    first time it's colonial unity against
    05:34
    the British probably one of the biggest
    05:37
    ones was the issue of economics and
    05:40
    there were British taxes without
    05:41
    colonial representation or consent the
    05:45
    colonists and mine paying taxes to their
    05:48
    colonial governments but they did mind
    05:50
    paying taxes to the British government
    05:52
    and Parliament created taxes without
    05:54
    colonial representation and with
    05:57
    colonists like hey we want some
    05:58
    representation the British said you are
    06:00
    you're virtually represented because you
    06:03
    are a part of the British Empire we have
    06:04
    your best interests at heart and the
    06:06
    colonists were not buying it they were
    06:08
    okay with colonial taxes because they
    06:10
    could vote for representation but they
    06:12
    could not vote for representation in the
    06:14
    British government so the colonists
    06:16
    successfully boycotted taxes like the
    06:18
    stand back through the Stamp Act
    06:20
    Congress in which they boycotted these
    06:22
    the the Stamp Act and tarred and
    06:24
    feathered these collectors and also the
    06:25
    Townsend acts they developed more
    06:27
    resolve in their case so every time the
    06:30
    British overturned a tax accountants
    06:32
    like look we basically have a say in
    06:34
    what we're doing so any texts we don't
    06:37
    like we'll just boycott it
    06:38
    and here is a poster from the British
    06:41
    side depicting the colonists is treating
    06:44
    the tax collectors very harshly they're
    06:45
    tarring and feathering this guy and
    06:47
    dumping a whole bunch of tea down his
    06:48
    throat so how the colonists justify
    06:51
    their resistance while they did so in
    06:54
    many different ways they argued that
    06:57
    they should have the same rights as they
    06:59
    should have rights of British subjects
    07:01
    as saying people living in Britain and
    07:03
    they rejected the idea of virtual
    07:04
    representation and they didn't like they
    07:07
    didn't believe that our parliament acted
    07:09
    in the best interest of all British
    07:11
    subjects and they also drew on the
    07:13
    rights of individuals again this idea of
    07:15
    the Enlightenment in this that people
    07:17
    should have a say in taxation they hated
    07:19
    the writs of assistance which were
    07:21
    open-ended search warrants that the
    07:22
    British used to basically search
    07:25
    colonial ships and these Admiralty
    07:27
    courts where there was no trial by jury
    07:29
    and you were guilty until proven
    07:31
    innocent they the colonists argued that
    07:34
    that violated their rights as
    07:35
    individuals and of course Enlightenment
    07:38
    ideas things like consent of the
    07:40
    governed life liberty and property from
    07:41
    our boy who came up with this John Locke
    07:44
    you got it there he is in local
    07:46
    traditions of self-rule because the
    07:48
    colonists were left alone for so long
    07:50
    and they were able to elect their own
    07:51
    colonial representatives they wanted a
    07:54
    greater say in the British government so
    07:56
    who were some individuals that were
    07:58
    heavily involved in the independence
    08:00
    movement why he had colonial leaders
    08:01
    like Paul Revere and John Hancock they
    08:03
    were wealthy merchants that protested
    08:05
    taxation especially John Hancock you had
    08:08
    Ben Franklin who argued that America
    08:10
    contributed significantly to the Seven
    08:13
    Years War through colonial taxes and Men
    08:15
    during the war itself and he was an
    08:18
    instrumental co-writer in the
    08:20
    Declaration of Independence and during
    08:22
    the American Revolution he really helped
    08:24
    gain support of France during that war
    08:27
    which provided vital aid to the
    08:29
    Americans we all said grassroots we also
    08:32
    had a grassroots movement just average
    08:35
    American colonists like laborers
    08:37
    artisans and women merci Otis Warren
    08:40
    she was his influential female writer
    08:43
    that urged independence now let's jump
    08:46
    on over to patreon mobilizations were
    08:48
    were gearing up for war the
    08:50
    large numbers of men and women that
    08:53
    contributed to the war effort they did
    08:55
    so by providing financial and material
    08:58
    support as well as troops now the
    09:01
    British were heavy odds on favorites in
    09:04
    the beginning of the war but ultimately
    09:06
    as we know they did not win so the
    09:08
    British had the advantages of loyalist
    09:11
    opposition pretty much one in five
    09:13
    people were loyal to the crown they had
    09:17
    a much bigger military and much more
    09:19
    money than the Americans did now America
    09:22
    did have their own advantages they're
    09:24
    familiar with the land they great
    09:26
    military leadership under people like
    09:28
    George Washington they were deeply
    09:30
    committed to their cause this idea of
    09:32
    liberty and freedom and they had
    09:34
    valuable foreign aid most notably the
    09:37
    French after the Battle of Saratoga in
    09:40
    which Americans defeat the British and
    09:42
    France is like holy cow they might
    09:43
    actually like gain independence let's
    09:45
    stick it to the British inside with the
    09:47
    Americans let's go over some test steps

    you're all awesome best of luck this
    00:37
    year especially in May alright let's
    00:40
    take a look at key concept 3.38 states
    00:42
    migration within North America a
    00:44
    competition over resources boundaries
    00:46
    and trade intensified conflicts among
    00:49
    peoples and nations that's from page 41
    00:51
    of the curriculum framework so some big
    00:54
    ideas what were achieving of the
    00:56
    northwest land ordinance we will talk
    00:57
    about this it's specifically mentioned
    00:59
    very very important number two how did
    01:02
    foreign policy debates impact America
    01:04
    domestically we're going to get into
    01:06
    foreign policy issues with Britain and
    01:08
    France in particular and a little bit of
    01:11
    Spain and finally George Washington's
    01:13
    farewell address what was the message of
    01:15
    it and did America heed his message we
    01:18
    shall find out alright Roman numeral one
    01:21
    states in the decades after American
    01:22
    independence interactions among
    01:24
    different groups resulted in competition
    01:26
    for resources shifting alliances and
    01:28
    cultural blending so let's take a look
    01:31
    at relations with Native Americans post
    01:33
    Revolutionary War now a lot of this land
    01:36
    that the United States gained at one
    01:38
    time belonged to the French and then the
    01:40
    British and now the Americans and the
    01:42
    Americans are no longer being held back
    01:44
    by that proclamation light so they're
    01:45
    going to start to expand further west
    01:48
    especially into the Ohio Valley area
    01:50
    okay so let's jump over the Battle of
    01:52
    Fallen Timbers this was where Native
    01:54
    Americans led by little turtle were
    01:55
    defeated and 630 Americans were killed
    01:58
    in the battle in and later on that year
    02:00
    the Indian side the Treaty of Grenville
    02:03
    in this treaty and in this treaty Native
    02:05
    American ceded or were forced to give up
    02:07
    a significant amount of land they were
    02:09
    allowed to retain some of their land
    02:11
    however but later on that was in
    02:13
    approached upon and here is the Treaty
    02:15
    of Grenville treaty life britain and
    02:17
    natives relationship contributed to
    02:19
    tensions with the US and we'll see this
    02:22
    in the war of 1812 so live Americans
    02:24
    will be upset with the British because
    02:25
    the British will be supplying weapons to
    02:27
    Native Americans and encouraging them to
    02:30
    attack or have hostile relations with
    02:32
    the American and this will be one of the
    02:34
    causes of the war of 1812 so keep that
    02:37
    in the back of your mind that bring in
    02:38
    the Native Americans their relationship
    02:40
    will create tension and hostility by the
    02:42
    Americans
    02:43
    alright frontier cultures when we're
    02:45
    talking about the frontier it's kind of
    02:47
    that East meets West line or
    02:48
    civilization meets the wilderness and
    02:50
    one group that you need to be familiar
    02:52
    with are the scots-irish an example the
    02:54
    scots-irish are the Paxton boys now the
    02:56
    scots-irish they tended to set on the
    02:58
    frontier the edges of settlement and
    03:00
    they would settle on land without regard
    03:02
    for ownership so they didn't weren't
    03:03
    really concerned who was living there
    03:05
    whether belong to the government whether
    03:06
    blended Native Americans whomever they
    03:08
    just took it now they did this place in
    03:11
    suppressed Native Americans and the
    03:12
    Paxton boys the march of the Paxton boys
    03:14
    is an example this this is in
    03:16
    Pennsylvania when many scots-irish went
    03:18
    on and massacred many Native American
    03:20
    women and children so there would be
    03:23
    lots of tension with Americans living
    03:25
    another frontier and Native Americans
    03:27
    because they want that Native American
    03:28
    land Shay's rebellion holy cow star
    03:31
    circle and highlight no this bad boy
    03:34
    super super important so this is a
    03:35
    rebellion of farmers this is in the
    03:37
    waning years of the Articles of
    03:39
    Confederation or the later decreasing
    03:41
    years and the these were many farmers
    03:44
    that demanded an end to foreclosures
    03:46
    what's a foreclosure that's when a bank
    03:48
    will take your farm because you can't
    03:49
    pay for they also wanted an end for
    03:51
    imprisonment for debt and they wanted
    03:53
    more paper currency so they went on this
    03:56
    long rebellion for several months they
    03:58
    closed courts and eventually was put
    04:00
    down but it took a long time because
    04:02
    there was a very weak central government
    04:03
    under the Articles of Confederation
    04:05
    absolutely positively know that now both
    04:08
    of these cultures Illustrated tensions
    04:11
    between the poor or those living in the
    04:13
    back country and the wealthier those
    04:15
    living in the interior a lot of these
    04:16
    rebellions throw us history that we've
    04:18
    learned about so far can really be
    04:20
    summed up as a conflict between the rich
    04:23
    and the poor okay northwest land
    04:25
    ordinance star this bad boy - holy cow
    04:27
    no it involves these states that are
    04:29
    highlighted in black does several things
    04:32
    you should know all of them one it
    04:34
    created a process to admit new states to
    04:36
    the country so once a population of
    04:38
    60,000 was reached in that territory for
    04:41
    example the Ohio territory it could
    04:44
    apply to become a state it also
    04:46
    guaranteed freedom of religion and trial
    04:48
    by jury and this is in 1787 so were
    04:51
    several years before the Bill of Rights
    04:53
    so this is pretty monumental for the
    04:55
    time a portion of land sales went to
    04:57
    fund education so each Township would be
    05:00
    divided into a six by six square mile
    05:03
    Township or 36 square miles the 16th
    05:07
    square mile that money that was used to
    05:10
    purchase that 16 square mile that money
    05:13
    would go towards public education so
    05:15
    there was a big focus on education in
    05:17
    the north in the northwest land
    05:19
    ordinance also slavery was abolished in
    05:22
    the territory this is the first
    05:23
    congressional ban
    05:24
    anywhere in the United States on slavery
    05:27
    so slavery never existed anywhere in the
    05:29
    Northwest Territory there's also
    05:31
    protection of private property this idea
    05:34
    that individuals cannot have their land
    05:36
    taken away by the government very
    05:38
    important absolutely no all five of
    05:41
    those please so talk about government
    05:43
    relations with natives in the
    05:44
    Constitution there was absolutely no
    05:45
    mention of the treatment or relations
    05:48
    with natives and they did not have
    05:50
    representation in government Native
    05:52
    Americans they were not able to vote and
    05:54
    they didn't have people in the
    05:55
    government that were really looking out
    05:56
    for their best interests and this would
    05:58
    lead to issues over land and treaties
    06:01
    that would be violated later on and we
    06:03
    just talked about the Treaty of
    06:04
    Granville even some of that land that
    06:06
    they were allowed to keep they
    06:07
    eventually lost because of encroachment
    06:10
    from American let's jump on over to
    06:12
    Spain in California in the 1760s are
    06:14
    expanding on their settlements into
    06:16
    California and they establish missions
    06:18
    or forts that were created and trade
    06:20
    expanded as well and many natives a
    06:23
    continuing theme unfortunately in the
    06:24
    1700s many of them died from disease and
    06:27
    others were forced to convert to
    06:28
    Christianity all right key concept three
    06:30
    point three Roman numeral to the
    06:31
    continued presence of European powers in
    06:33
    North America challenged the United
    06:35
    States to find ways to safeguard its
    06:37
    borders maintain neutral trading rights
    06:39
    and promote its eken
    06:41
    make interests let's talk about some
    06:42
    diplomatic initiatives well we have
    06:44
    Jay's treaty and this is with Great
    06:46
    Britain in 1795 so what this is is
    06:49
    really kind of a continuation of what
    06:52
    the two countries the US and Britain
    06:54
    agreed at the end of the American
    06:55
    Revolution
    06:56
    we had the British were damaging some
    06:59
    ships and they were impressing American
    07:02
    soldier American sailors or forcing them
    07:04
    to join the British Navy and John Jay
    07:08
    went over there in the US did receive
    07:09
    compensation for these damaged ships
    07:11
    Britain also promised to leave forts or
    07:15
    posts that they were occupying still
    07:16
    after the Revolutionary War but they did
    07:20
    not end up leaving Jay's treaty is one
    07:22
    cause of the development of political
    07:24
    parties because many Americans were
    07:26
    upset over Jay's treaty and disliked
    07:28
    Britain so much Pinkney's treaty also in
    07:31
    1795 is a treaty with Spain and it all
    07:34
    goes back to this little city down here
    07:36
    New Orleans in the Mississippi River so
    07:39
    the u.s. granted net the u.s. was
    07:41
    granted navigation rights on the
    07:43
    Mississippi River they were now allowed
    07:45
    to go up and down and trade on and most
    07:48
    importantly they had what's known as the
    07:50
    right of deposit the ability to store
    07:52
    goods in New Orleans and selva New
    07:55
    Orleans was very very very important for
    07:57
    trade so where were the impacts of the
    07:59
    war between Britain and France well when
    08:01
    the French Revolution breaks out those
    08:02
    two countries start going to war with
    08:04
    each other and keep in mind that the
    08:07
    French Revolution as well as other
    08:09
    revolutions were influenced by the
    08:10
    American Revolution and Enlightenment
    08:11
    ideas now the u.s. saw to remain neutral
    08:14
    in the conflict between these two
    08:16
    countries France and Britain both sought
    08:19
    to keep the u.s. from trading with the
    08:21
    other so Britain would do things like
    08:22
    confiscate American ships that are on
    08:25
    the way to France and France would do
    08:27
    the same thing and again this idea I
    08:29
    just talked about if kidnapping American
    08:30
    sailors is known as impressment this is
    08:32
    something that Britain would do they
    08:34
    would take the soldiers they aboard the
    08:36
    ship and say hey guess what you're now
    08:37
    in the British Navy this is a major
    08:39
    cause of the war of 1812 and the impacts
    08:42
    of war between Britain and France is
    08:44
    another cause of emergence of political
    08:46
    parties because you have people like
    08:49
    Jefferson who tended to support the
    08:51
    French and his followers he's like vive
    08:52
    la France ho ho ho
    08:54
    we love them because they just overthrow
    08:56
    through their monarch like we overthrew
    08:59
    kg3 not too long before and on the other
    09:01
    side you have Alexander Hamilton who
    09:03
    will support the British because he's
    09:04
    all about trade and Britain is the
    09:06
    biggest trading partner in the country
    09:08
    now Washington leaves office his
    09:10
    farewell address becomes a cornerstone
    09:12
    of u.s. foreign policy and encouraged
    09:14
    national unity and he warned against two
    09:17
    things that you should absolutely no one
    09:18
    said no political parties their bed stay
    09:21
    away from them and to stay away from
    09:24
    permanent foreign alliances as well so
    09:27
    do not be entangled with foreign
    09:30
    countries nothing good can come from it
    09:32
    and clearly the u.s. listened to him on
    09:34
    number one and listened to my number two
    09:37
    not at all political parties developed
    09:39
    almost immediately after he left office
    09:41
    and although the US did avoid permanent
    09:44
    alliances for a while eventually the
    09:46
    u.s. changes its position now for a test
    09:48
    whether it's multiple choice short
    09:50
    answer or an essay be able to connect
    09:52
    this idea of permanent foreign alliances
    09:53
    to the failed Treaty of Versailles in
    09:56
    1919 after World War one and then the
    09:58
    u.s. kind of switching its position and
    10:00
    joining NATO in joining the United
    10:02
    Nations after World War two finally
    10:05
    after World War two Washington's
    10:07
    farewell address is no longer haunting
    10:09
    the country in terms of permanent
    10:11
    Lance's alright some tested for multiple
    10:14
    choice and short answer again
    10:15
    Washington's farewell address no it
    10:17
    northwest land ordinance the
    10:18
    achievements how could this be seen as
    10:20
    sectional tension think about what they
    10:22
    outlawed reasons for the development of
    10:24
    political parties be able to identify a
    10:25
    couple them that we talked about in here
    10:27
    and for essay questions issues that led
    10:30
    to the creation of political parties be
    10:33
    able to describe them alright guys thank
    10:35
    you very much for watching I look
    10:36
    forward to seeing right back here with
    10:37
    key concept for point one when we talk
    10:39
    about this dude John Marshall and his

    00:00
    hey what's going on a push peach I got a
    00:01
    great short video for you today we are
    00:03
    gonna peep out why 1763 was such an
    00:07
    important year alright so when you see
    00:10
    1763 I want you to think a watershed
    00:13
    year what does watershed mean it means a
    00:15
    turning point if you want a while some
    00:18
    aap readers in your short answer long
    00:20
    essay or DBQ use the word watershed it
    00:23
    means it is the enormous ly important
    00:25
    time or event and it is a turning point
    00:27
    meaning that things drastically changed
    00:29
    now how are you going to remember this
    00:31
    I'll give you visually to remember
    00:33
    watershed I want you to spell the
    00:36
    watershed out as it is turning because
    00:40
    it is a turning point so when you see
    00:43
    the word watershed visualize it spelled
    00:45
    out in a circle as it is turning around
    00:47
    a point in the middle here so watershed
    00:51
    equals turning points so why was six
    00:53
    1763 a turning point I'm gonna give you
    00:55
    an acronym to remember and it is PPE EEP
    00:59
    first P stands for Pontiacs rebellion
    01:01
    that happened in 1763 also we see the
    01:05
    end of the Seven Years War the French
    01:06
    and Indian War that led directly to the
    01:09
    end of salutary neglect by the British
    01:12
    so the end of the Seven Years War led to
    01:14
    the end of salutary neglect the e caused
    01:16
    the e now the P is going to cause the
    01:19
    other P in 1763 the proclamation line of
    01:23
    1763 Pyne amateur bang a lot of the
    01:26
    fighting took place over here west of
    01:28
    the Appalachian Mountains so the British
    01:29
    said you know what we're going to avoid
    01:30
    conflict with the natives by passing the
    01:32
    proclamation line of 1763 which forbid
    01:35
    expansion beyond the Appalachian
    01:38
    Mountains now pass AP exam they asked a
    01:40
    lot about this information so make sure
    01:42
    you remember 1763 is all about peep I
    01:46
    will leave you with this this is a six
    01:48
    not a nine it's upside down 1763 turning
    01:51
    around in a circle around a point peep
    01:53
    turning around a circle right at a point
    01:55
    because it is a watershed year thanks

    00:00
    hey what's going on ap people we have a
    00:03
    push review Thomas Paine's Common Sense
    00:05
    for you on the docket today this is
    00:08
    something that specifically mentioned in
    00:09
    the new aid push curriculum though you
    00:11
    should definitely be familiar with so
    00:13
    let's get going and covering common
    00:15
    sense so let's look at the a push
    00:17
    curriculum key concept 3.2 Roman numeral
    00:20
    one letter B States the following the
    00:22
    colonists belief in the superiority of
    00:24
    Republican self-government based on the
    00:27
    natural rights of the people found it's
    00:29
    clearest American expression and Thomas
    00:32
    Paine's Common Sense and in the
    00:35
    Declaration of Independence and this is
    00:37
    located in page 34 of the curriculum
    00:40
    flame framework which you can download
    00:41
    in the description below definitely be
    00:43
    familiar with those guys and common
    00:45
    sense played an intricate role in
    00:47
    influencing the colonists decision to
    00:49
    declare independence and as I mentioned
    00:52
    earlier since it is specifically
    00:54
    mentioned in the new curriculum you
    00:55
    should be very familiar with it let's do
    00:57
    a little background I common sense but
    00:59
    before we get to it let's review some
    01:02
    events that happen prior to its
    01:04
    publication in January of 1776 well
    01:07
    let's go back here to 1775 we have in
    01:11
    April of that year the battles of
    01:12
    Lexington and Concord between the
    01:14
    colonists and the British and these are
    01:16
    known as the first battles in the
    01:18
    Revolutionary War even though they had
    01:20
    been before the Declaration of
    01:21
    Independence these are nicknamed a shot
    01:23
    heard round the world in July of that
    01:25
    year the Continental Congress issues the
    01:29
    Olive Branch petition which is the
    01:32
    colonists hope to have peace and have
    01:35
    their grievances addressed by Britain
    01:38
    and King George the 3rd and King George
    01:39
    the 3rd rejects the Olive Branch
    01:41
    petition if you see an olive branch
    01:43
    that's a kind of an international symbol
    01:45
    for peace throughout 1775 in the early
    01:47
    part of 1776 most colonists did not want
    01:50
    independence that's very important to
    01:52
    know guess it's not until later of 1776
    01:55
    and rather they were seeking a redress
    01:57
    of their grievances basically hate
    01:59
    England fix our complaints and go back
    02:02
    to the days of salutary neglect all
    02:04
    right so we're going to answer time as
    02:06
    paint or t-pain who was he well here's a
    02:08
    picture of him he was a philosopher
    02:10
    philosopher from England that moved to
    02:12
    America in
    02:14
    1974 and he his ideas reflected the
    02:17
    ideas of that time period known as the
    02:20
    Enlightenment I do have a video on the
    02:21
    alignment in the description as well
    02:23
    that's another thing that specifically
    02:24
    mentioned the new curriculum so why did
    02:28
    he publish common sense well he urged
    02:30
    America and colonists to break away from
    02:33
    Britain and King George the 3rd and
    02:36
    here's a statue of Thomas Paine that I
    02:38
    absolutely love look this guy's like
    02:40
    stomping on the ground cheering and
    02:42
    screaming break away from the British
    02:46
    alright so let's talk about the message
    02:48
    of common sense and the impact of it
    02:50
    well the book was divided into four
    02:52
    sections the first one is the origins of
    02:55
    government and remarks on English
    02:57
    Constitution so basically like what his
    02:59
    thoughts are on government to the
    03:02
    monarchy and hereditary succession this
    03:05
    idea that Kings are only Kings because
    03:07
    well if they're born into the right
    03:09
    family 3 the present state of American
    03:12
    affairs and this is where he talked
    03:13
    about all the issues that are going on
    03:15
    in America and for the present ability
    03:18
    of America in this idea that America
    03:20
    really has come into its own and can
    03:22
    break away and the important thing to
    03:25
    note about who it was written for the
    03:27
    audience of this and this is something
    03:29
    that the new curriculum you're supposed
    03:31
    to be able to identify the audience of
    03:33
    writings the audience was the common
    03:36
    people and he wanted his average
    03:38
    everyday Americans you know it was said
    03:40
    in 1776 that 1/3 of Americans wanted
    03:43
    independence 1/3 did not want
    03:46
    independence and 1/3 were on the fence
    03:47
    and he kind of wrote that to the people
    03:49
    on the fence to urge them to break away
    03:51
    he said it was common sense to break
    03:53
    away and proportionally to the
    03:56
    population at that time in 1776 that is
    03:59
    the best-selling book in American
    04:01
    history as many as 500,000 copies were
    04:05
    distributed to a population of two and a
    04:08
    half million so one out of five people
    04:10
    in America read his book he was
    04:13
    channeling his inner Oprah during this
    04:15
    time he's like you get a common sense
    04:16
    you get a common sense you get a common
    04:19
    sense and you get one and you get one
    04:21
    and finally you get a common sense as
    04:23
    well all right so let's go over some
    04:25
    test tips for you with
    04:27
    commonsense multiple choice and short
    04:29
    answer questions if you see anything in
    04:31
    those perhaps you would have an excerpt
    04:33
    from the reading from common sense and
    04:35
    you would have to be able to identify
    04:36
    what the purpose is for a short answer
    04:38
    you get kind of it would give you three
    04:41
    topics as I explained how those
    04:42
    contributed to the American Revolution
    04:43
    and common sense could be one of those
    04:45
    for an essay question the chances have
    04:47
    you seen one solely a common sense is
    04:49
    pretty much zero but it could be part of
    04:51
    the influences or the causes of the
    04:54
    American Revolution which is why your
    04:55
    essay could be about alright hopefully I
    04:58
    was able to clarify t-pain's common
    05:00
    sense for you guys today if you have a
    05:02

    05:03

    Great Britain now there's lots of debate
    00:41
    in the United States should the United
    00:43
    States side with the French or should
    00:44
    they stay out of it so Washington's
    00:46
    going to issue the following
    00:47
    proclamation in 1793 he says the duty
    00:51
    and interest of the United States
    00:53
    require that they should adopt a conduct
    00:55
    friendly and impartial or staying out of
    00:57
    it toward the warring powers I have
    01:00
    thought fit to declare the position of
    01:02
    the United States to observe it conduct
    01:03
    towards these powers respectfully and
    01:05
    one our citizens to avoid all acts which
    01:08
    may in any manner tend to go against
    01:11
    this position and you're looking at this
    01:13
    picture you know that this is
    01:15
    Christopher Jackson from Hamilton the
    01:17
    musical if you have not listened to it I
    01:20
    will tell you some songs that you must
    01:21
    that will greatly help you out in a push
    01:23
    so this highlighted the disputes between
    01:26
    Jefferson or the Democratic Republicans
    01:28
    and Hamilton the Federalists Jefferson
    01:30
    was a supporter of the French and he
    01:33
    felt the United States should side with
    01:34
    them Hamilton believed the US should
    01:37
    stay out of it and a great summary of
    01:39
    this could be found on the Hamilton
    01:40
    musicals kept soundtrack cabinet battle
    01:43
    number two listen to it and this will
    01:46
    make sense forever for you alright so
    01:48
    watch it it's very well dressed jumping
    01:50
    over to this is specifically mentioned
    01:51
    in the new a push curriculum and this
    01:55
    topic is great for multiple choice and
    01:57
    short answer questions and some Big Idea
    01:59
    questions how to wash you to view
    02:01
    political parties and how did his ideas
    02:03
    help influence foreign policy for
    02:05
    decades to come
    02:06
    all right some historical background
    02:07
    this was issued in 1796 Washington left
    02:10
    office and this was written by why
    02:13
    and his boy his close friend Alexander
    02:16
    Hamilton this helped influence US
    02:18
    foreign policy for years to come
    02:21
    so almost any foreign policy si this
    02:23
    could be a synthesis point for you so
    02:27
    some key parts of the address while he
    02:29
    warned of foreign entanglements and part
    02:31
    of this said the great will of conduct
    02:33
    for us in regard to foreign nations is
    02:35
    in extending our commercial relations to
    02:38
    have with them as little political
    02:40
    connection as possible so far as we have
    02:42
    already formed in engagements let them
    02:45
    be fulfilled with perfect good-faith
    02:46
    Europe has a set of primary interests
    02:49
    for which to us have none or ver or a
    02:53
    very remote relation so Washington's
    02:56
    basically a like look trade is good but
    02:59
    Alliance is not so good it is our true
    03:01
    policy to steer clear permanent
    03:03
    alliances with any portion of the
    03:04
    foreign world so far I mean as we are
    03:07
    now what Liberty to do it for let me not
    03:09
    be understood as capable of patronizing
    03:11
    in fidelity to existing engagement so
    03:14
    he's basically saying I don't want to I
    03:15
    don't want to knock on these current
    03:17
    engagements I hold the maxim no less
    03:19
    applicable to public than to private
    03:22
    affairs that honesty is always the best
    03:24
    policy I repeat it therefore let these
    03:27
    engagements because they're observed in
    03:29
    their genuine sense but in my opinion it
    03:31
    is unnecessary and would be unwise to
    03:34
    extend them so stay out of European
    03:36
    affairs so his ghost this message will
    03:40
    hover over foreign policy debates for
    03:42
    decades to come especially when it comes
    03:44
    a world war one after it there's huge
    03:47
    debates about whether or not the United
    03:48
    States should join the League of Nations
    03:49
    that's because of Washington's address
    03:52
    so this is a continuity really until
    03:54
    after World War two that the US will
    03:56
    stay out of European foreign affairs he
    03:59
    also warned a political parties and he
    04:01
    said the alternate domination of one
    04:03
    faction or party over another sharpened
    04:05
    by the spirit of revenge natural to
    04:07
    party dissension which in different ages
    04:10
    and countries has perpetrated the most
    04:12
    horrid enormities is itself a frightful
    04:15
    despot despotism the disorders and
    04:18
    miseries which results gradually incline
    04:20
    the minds of men to seek security and
    04:23
    response and absolute power of an
    04:24
    individual and sooner or later the
    04:27
    chief of some prevailing faction more
    04:28
    able or more fortunate than his
    04:31
    competitors turns us disposition to the
    04:33
    purpose of his own elevation on the
    04:36
    ruins of public Liberty that's a fancy
    04:38
    way of saying political parties are bad
    04:41
    and this is not followed by the country
    04:44
    and check out more in his farewell
    04:46
    address from the Hamilton soundtrack
    04:48
    that song one last time it's Washington
    04:50
    and Hamilton talking about what will be
    04:52
    in his message and how he's stepping
    04:54
    down after two turn and for not
    04:56
    listening Washington basically is ok
    04:58
    guys thanks for listening and Jefferson

    00:00
    hey what's going on a push peeps I got
    00:01
    another good one for you today this is
    00:03
    on the first party system a great
    00:07
    potential short answer question or as a
    00:09
    topic guess what if you're one of my
    00:11
    students listening to this you're doing
    00:13
    an essay on it surprise okay let's get
    00:16
    going so the new curriculum states this
    00:18
    about the first party system flipped a
    00:20
    key cuz of 3.2 Roman numeral three
    00:22
    letter B and it says political leaders
    00:25
    in the 1790s took a variety of positions
    00:27
    on issues such as the relationship
    00:29
    between the national government and the
    00:30
    state's economic policy foreign policy
    00:33
    and the balance between liberty and
    00:35
    order this led to the formation of
    00:38
    political parties most significantly the
    00:40
    Federalists led by Alexander Hamilton
    00:42
    and the Democratic Republican Party led
    00:45
    by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison so
    00:48
    it's gonna be Hamilton versus these two
    00:51
    dudes they do not get along well with
    00:53
    each other actually Jefferson and
    00:55
    Madison do but they do not get along
    00:57
    well with Hamilton alright so why did
    01:00
    they develop well there's four main
    01:02
    reasons number one over the power of the
    01:05
    federal government how strong should it
    01:06
    be to foreign policy and this really all
    01:10
    stems from the French Revolution
    01:12
    illustrated here with the storming of
    01:14
    the Bastille on July 14 1789 economic
    01:18
    policy stemming from Hamilton's
    01:20
    financial plan and finally the balance
    01:22
    between liberty and order and this stems
    01:24
    from the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798
    01:27
    under President John Adams
    01:30
    administration so let's discuss the
    01:32
    power of the federal government so
    01:35
    Federalists favored a strong a stronger
    01:38
    national or federal or central those are
    01:40
    interchangeable words government and
    01:42
    here is Alexander Hamilton played by
    01:45
    lin-manuel Miranda at the Treasury
    01:47
    Department in Washington DC I'm gonna be
    01:50
    referencing Hamilton the musical a lot
    01:52
    in this video
    01:53
    Democrat Republicans favored a smaller
    01:55
    federal government so they were more
    01:57
    weary of the central government being
    02:00
    too powerful Madison and this dude
    02:04
    Jefferson argued that states should be
    02:06
    able to nullify federal laws and we see
    02:08
    this with the Virginia and the Kentucky
    02:10
    resolutions which we'll talk more about
    02:12
    in a few
    02:13
    moment so the democratic-republicans
    02:16
    believe that states state government
    02:17
    should have a lot of power that they
    02:19
    should even be able to go so far as to
    02:21
    nullify federal laws and here is daveed
    02:25
    Diggs who plays Thomas Jefferson in the
    02:28
    musical
    02:29
    all right foreign policy Democratic
    02:31
    Republicans tended to support France and
    02:34
    there's a couple reasons why number one
    02:36
    France provided aid during the
    02:37
    Revolutionary War come on what's that
    02:39
    battle after what battle it's
    02:40
    illustrated here yeah you know you will
    02:43
    genius it is the Battle of Saratoga
    02:45
    great job also the Declaration of
    02:48
    Independence inspired the French
    02:50
    Revolution and guess who gets credit for
    02:51
    writing the Declaration of Independence
    02:52
    you know at Thomas Jefferson so he is so
    02:55
    honored that his ideas helped inspire
    02:57
    revolutions throughout the world
    02:59
    Federalists want to have a beneficial
    03:01
    relationship with England they saw
    03:03
    England as a major trading partner and
    03:05
    this is exhibited through Jay's treaty
    03:07
    which was negotiated by Chief Justice
    03:09
    John Jay the first Chief Justice of the
    03:12
    Supreme Court and this made Britain a
    03:15
    favourable trading partner even
    03:18
    preferential treatment when it comes to
    03:20
    trade and this really upset the French
    03:21
    and when France and England went to war
    03:24
    in the 1790s democratic Republicans
    03:26
    wanted to support France and the
    03:28
    Federalists wanted to remain neutral and
    03:30
    Washington is going to side with the
    03:33
    Federalists and remain neutral when he
    03:36
    issues his neutrality proclamation I got
    03:38
    a video on that if you need more info on
    03:40
    it
    03:40
    okay economic policy this is really the
    03:42
    first major difference between Jefferson
    03:44
    and Hamilton Hamilton's financial plan
    03:47
    pitted Hamilton against Jefferson and
    03:51
    Madison the bank of the US or the bus as
    03:53
    I call it was the most controversial
    03:55
    aspect this really made Jefferson and
    03:59
    his followers upset Jeff says followers
    04:02
    took a strict interpretation versus a
    04:05
    loose interpretation by the Federalists
    04:07
    when it comes to reading the
    04:09
    Constitution and Hamilton said listen
    04:11
    the Constitution doesn't say we cannot
    04:13
    have a bank therefore we can that's a
    04:16
    loose interpretation whereas the
    04:18
    Democratic Republic had said no I don't
    04:20
    think so buddy the Constitution doesn't
    04:21
    say you can therefore you can't and
    04:24
    ultimately Washington played here by
    04:26
    Christopher Jackson supports the bus and
    04:29
    sides with the Federalist of Washington
    04:32
    is often going to side with Hamilton
    04:34
    when their debates between Hamilton and
    04:37
    Jefferson in his first administration
    04:39
    let's jump on over to balance between
    04:41
    liberty and order the Alien and Sedition
    04:43
    Act 1798 under President John Adams
    04:46
    these are passed to silence his
    04:49
    Democratic Republican opponents know
    04:52
    this is very interesting the runner-up
    04:53
    in the presidential election back then
    04:55
    became the vice president so we have
    04:58
    Thomas Jefferson as John Adams vice
    05:01
    president even though he is a member of
    05:03
    a different political party so lots of
    05:05
    tension between the two so they only in
    05:08
    Sedition Acts are past men and they are
    05:11
    meant to punish Democratic Republicans
    05:14
    and punishments for criticizing the
    05:16
    government included fines and/or jail
    05:19
    time so if you were a newspaper editor
    05:21
    and critical of John Adams you could be
    05:23
    thrown in jail for and Jefferson again
    05:26
    who is Adams VP and Madison they respond
    05:29
    with the Virginia and Kentucky
    05:30
    resolutions and Jefferson's basically
    05:32
    like dude you're not going to silence me
    05:34
    I have an idea and this idea is that
    05:36
    states should be able to nullify the
    05:38
    Alien and Sedition Acts so they are
    05:42
    trying to overturn or void these federal
    05:46
    laws all right so if you want more info
    05:50
    on any of on these topics I encourage

    time couple shoutouts one to Mr Summers

    I appreciate it if you want a shout-out
    00:34
    throw it in the comments and I will get
    00:36
    to it eventually
    00:37
    I promise all right let's take a look at
    00:39
    key concept 4.1 it states the United
    00:42
    States began to develop a modern
    00:43
    democracy and celebrate a new national
    00:45
    culture well Americans saw to define the
    00:47
    nation's democratic ideals and change
    00:50
    their society and institutions to match
    00:52
    them some so some big idea questions you
    00:54
    should be thinking about what were the
    00:56
    reasons for the development of political
    00:57
    parties definitely know this this to me
    01:00
    screams a short answer question if I'm
    01:02
    they pee people and I'm not but if I'm
    01:05
    writing a short answer question for your
    01:06
    test I'm going right to this the
    01:08
    development of political parties and
    01:10
    characteristics for each party how did
    01:12
    the Second Great Awakening impact
    01:14
    America yep that's right I said second
    01:16
    so we're going back to another Great
    01:17
    Awakening how did slaves adapt to their
    01:19
    circumstances and create a new culture
    01:22
    right he cuts a four point one Roman
    01:24
    numeral one says the nation's transition
    01:26
    to a more participatory democracy was
    01:28
    achieved by expanding suffrage from a
    01:30
    system based on property ownership to
    01:33
    one based on voting by all adult white
    01:35
    men and it was accompanied by the growth
    01:37
    of political parties so let's take a
    01:39
    look at the first political parties that
    01:40
    emerge now remember what a Washington
    01:43
    say about political parties he was like
    01:45
    nah man don't form them and as soon as
    01:47
    he said that they formed so Federalist
    01:50
    this is the first party system
    01:51
    Federalists they tended to favor a
    01:53
    strong central government hence the word
    01:55
    Federalists they said they were
    01:56
    supported by the upper-class merchants
    01:58
    and bankers as well and then were
    02:00
    pro-british this was because of trade
    02:03
    with Britain since a lot of them were
    02:04
    merchants and they focused on improving
    02:06
    the economy they were pro-british for
    02:08
    trading and they also favored a loose
    02:10
    interpretation of the Constitution
    02:13
    he'll Hamilton justified the Bank of the
    02:15
    United States he said look just because
    02:16
    it's not in there doesn't mean it can't
    02:18
    be done on the other end we the
    02:20
    democratic-republicans also known as the
    02:21
    Jeffersonians they were more states
    02:24
    rights oriented they were supported by
    02:25
    lower middle classes especially farmers
    02:28
    farmers were big fans of the
    02:29
    Jeffersonians they were pro French when
    02:32
    it came to foreign affairs because of
    02:33
    Frances help during the American
    02:36
    Revolution and also because of the
    02:37
    French Revolution look to the American
    02:40
    Declaration of Independence and they
    02:42
    also favored a strict interpretation of
    02:44
    the Constitution so unless the
    02:46
    Constitution said you can't do something
    02:47
    you can't they would argue now both
    02:50
    parties developed out of two reasons
    02:52
    they came about because of two reasons
    02:53
    this could be a short answer make sure
    02:55
    you can explain why they developed
    02:57
    Hamilton's financial plan and the French
    03:00
    Revolution will the Supreme Court
    03:01
    strengthen the power of the federal
    03:03
    government during this time and it was
    03:05
    often done at the expense of state
    03:07
    government so a couple core cases you
    03:09
    should be familiar with
    03:10
    we have Marbury vs. Madison from 1803
    03:12
    this established the principle of
    03:14
    judicial review the ability of the
    03:16
    Supreme Court on the national level to
    03:18
    declare laws unconstitutional and this
    03:21
    will be extended to state laws any later
    03:24
    court case
    03:24
    Fletcher versus Peck and McCulloch V
    03:27
    Maryland this upheld the
    03:28
    constitutionality of the second bank of
    03:30
    the United States and this gave the
    03:32
    federal government more power over
    03:33
    States States could not tax a federal
    03:36
    agency that they did not like and the
    03:40
    third Corps case you should know is
    03:41
    Gibbons versus Ogden this dealt with
    03:43
    boats on the Hudson River and what the
    03:45
    Supreme Court said is that Congress not
    03:47
    States can control interstate commerce
    03:50
    interstate means two or more I have an
    03:54
    article on my web page a link to in the
    03:56
    description and why we know that Chris
    03:58
    Brown and pitbull did not take AP US
    04:00
    history
    04:01
    check it out it relates to this case
    04:03
    because jump on over to Democrats and
    04:05
    Whigs they really develop in the 1820s
    04:07
    and 1830s the Democrats were led by
    04:09
    Andrew Jackson he was seen as the common
    04:11
    man and kind of continuing with the
    04:13
    Jeffersonians they were against the boss
    04:15
    and Henry Clay's American system I have
    04:18
    a just a video for the American system
    04:20
    in the description check it out I got a
    04:21
    bunch of videos that relates to this his
    04:24
    American system focused on the Bank of
    04:25
    the United States
    04:26
    internal improvements and tariffs no on
    04:29
    the other end we had the Whigs led by my
    04:31
    boy Henry Clay there's a young Henry
    04:33
    Clay
    04:33
    they developed because they were anti
    04:35
    Andrew Jackson they favored a stronger
    04:38
    federal government internal improvements
    04:40
    tariffs and the boss or the Bank of the
    04:42
    United States so this is really kind of
    04:44
    almost a continuation least of the ideas
    04:46
    of the Federalist Party now regional
    04:49
    political and economic loyalties
    04:51
    overshadowed national concerns what does
    04:53
    that mean well people tended to be more
    04:56
    loyal to the region than they were the
    04:58
    nation and we see this in the
    05:00
    nullification crisis of the 1830s where
    05:02
    South Carolina led by Dracula I mean
    05:05
    John C Calhoun really he and other
    05:08
    states opposed the tariffs of 1828 and
    05:11
    1832 which were really high and in South
    05:13
    Carolina takes it a step further and
    05:15
    even nullified those tariffs and they
    05:19
    told Andrew Jackson its president hey
    05:20
    you try to collect these terrorists by
    05:22
    force or collect them in all we will
    05:24
    secede so really the country is on the
    05:26
    break of the Civil War during the
    05:28
    nullification crisis and during the same
    05:30
    time we have Webster's Daniel Webster
    05:32
    his second reply to him this was in the
    05:34
    Senate this really demonstrated that
    05:36
    Webster wanted to promote nationalism
    05:38
    over sectionalism so we see the
    05:40
    emergence of some leaders like a Henry
    05:42
    Clay like a Daniel Webster who are
    05:44
    saying hey America is more important
    05:46
    than your region I have videos for these
    05:49
    as well in the description okay four
    05:51
    point one Roman numeral two while
    05:52
    Americans embraced a new national
    05:54
    culture various groups developed
    05:55
    distinctive cultures of their own we're
    05:58
    gonna focus on the Second Great
    06:00
    Awakening they this time period saw to
    06:02
    inspire humans to achieve perfection so
    06:05
    we have this dude Charles G Finney
    06:07
    Charles Grant and Symphony he gave these
    06:09
    massive sermons to convert individuals
    06:12
    so he's really bringing people back to
    06:15
    religion and he's going to be very
    06:17
    influential in New York especially along
    06:20
    towns along in towns along the Erie
    06:22
    Canal utopian societies begin to develop
    06:25
    and these are social experiments I hope
    06:27
    to achieve perfection in communities we
    06:29
    have communities like Oneida Brook Farm
    06:31
    etc in which these these people really
    06:34
    live together and they're pretty
    06:35
    self-sufficient and they're trying to
    06:37
    achieve perfection in these
    06:39
    communities now the big thing to know
    06:41
    about the Second Great Awakening is it
    06:43
    inspires other reform movements things
    06:46
    like temperance and abolition and
    06:48
    education and we'll talk about more of
    06:49
    those in just a couple minutes now let's
    06:51
    jump over to the emergence of a new
    06:52
    national culture well this was a
    06:55
    combination of European and local
    06:57
    culture in American culture as well
    06:58
    there's new American art literature and
    07:01
    architectural ideas that emerged we see
    07:03
    John James Audubon who was this great
    07:07
    outdoorsman and made significant
    07:08
    contributions this study of birds prints
    07:11
    of birds he was discovered species left
    07:13
    and right and really his books became
    07:15
    very very popular and the Hudson River
    07:17
    school they focused on landscape
    07:19
    paintings and they believed nature was a
    07:21
    great source of wisdom and inspiration
    07:23
    so if you ever see a painting here's an
    07:25
    example the Hudson River School painting
    07:28
    if you ever see a painting of outdoors
    07:29
    or anything with environment chances are
    07:31
    it's going to be the Hudson River school
    07:33
    I always think River outdoors Hudson
    07:35
    River school
    07:36
    there you go literature art philosophy
    07:38
    and architecture reflected a belief in
    07:40
    human perfectibility and we see this
    07:43
    evident the transcendentalism movement
    07:45
    of the 1830s this really encouraging
    07:47
    individuals to have communication with
    07:49
    both God and nature now two famous
    07:51
    writers you should be familiar with is
    07:53
    one is Ralph Waldo Emerson he wrote
    07:55
    self-reliance and he believed that
    07:58
    individuals should follow their own
    07:59
    self-interest and the other dude is
    08:01
    Henry David Thoreau and he wrote two
    08:04
    influential books Walden and civil
    08:06
    disobedience now in Walden he wrote
    08:08
    about his experiences of living in
    08:09
    nature foodtube for two years at Walden
    08:11
    Pond in civil disobedience we know will
    08:13
    go on to influence people like Gandhi
    08:15
    and Martin Luther King during the civil
    08:17
    rights movement in 1850s and 1960s now
    08:21
    enslaved African Americans created
    08:22
    communities and they sought to protect
    08:24
    their family structures and dignity and
    08:25
    they did so by developing surrogate
    08:27
    families or kind of adopted families
    08:29
    when they were split up through the
    08:31
    slave trade when families were separated
    08:33
    others would look after family members
    08:36
    so they're really these elaborate system
    08:37
    set up to help deal with the horrific
    08:40
    loss of family members due to the slave
    08:43
    trade and slave was also developed and
    08:45
    this was you to help pass the time while
    08:47
    working and this played an instrumental
    08:50
    part of religious services that slaves
    08:52
    were part
    08:53
    as well alright four point one Roman
    08:56
    numeral three increasing number of
    08:58
    Americans numbers of Americans many
    09:00
    inspired by new religious and
    09:01
    intellectual movements worked primarily
    09:03
    outside of government institutions to
    09:05
    advance their ideals so what were some
    09:07
    organizations that attempted to approve
    09:09
    society and individual behavior while
    09:11
    the American Temperance Society which I
    09:13
    mentioned briefly earlier this was
    09:15
    co-founded by this dude Lyman Beecher
    09:16
    who happened to be the father of Harriet
    09:18
    Beecher Stowe
    09:19
    what did Harriet Beecher Stowe write you
    09:21
    know this come on very influential book
    09:22
    that's right Uncle Tom's Cabin by the
    09:25
    way she was from Cincinnati and this
    09:28
    really created thousands of chapters
    09:30
    throughout the United States the
    09:31
    American Temperance Society and you had
    09:33
    thousands and thousands of people who
    09:35
    committed to the temperance movement to
    09:37
    try to eliminate alcohol and this was
    09:40
    very closely aligned with the
    09:41
    abolitionist movement as well
    09:43
    now Dorothea Dix here is Dorothea she
    09:45
    saw to improve treatment for the
    09:47
    mentally ill and really made a big
    09:49
    difference in the treatment for this
    09:50
    group of people you have horse man here
    09:53
    is he's known as the father of education
    09:55
    I don't know about you he looks like a
    09:56
    teacher to me and we had shakers as well
    09:58
    this religious group that practiced
    10:00
    celibacy and they believed in sexual
    10:02
    equality so they were really advanced
    10:04
    for their time when it came to gender
    10:06
    equality for men and women abolitionists
    10:08
    and anti-slavery movements we'll talk
    10:10
    about now they achieved much of their
    10:13
    success in the north and many northern
    10:14
    states gradually emancipated their
    10:16
    slaves and by the early to mid 1800s
    10:19
    slavery was essentially non-existent in
    10:22
    the north and there was a create an
    10:23
    increasing number of free
    10:25
    african-americans in the north and in
    10:27
    the south as well and eventually many
    10:29
    states in the south made it illegal for
    10:31
    slave owners to manumit or free their
    10:34
    slaves we see it in places like Virginia
    10:36
    in particular after 1831 now
    10:40
    anti-slavery in the South was not very
    10:42
    successful in changing the status of
    10:45
    many slaves initially we seen the House
    10:48
    of Representatives on national level the
    10:50
    gag order which was instituted by the
    10:52
    south has prohibited the introduction of
    10:54
    abolitionist bills in the House of
    10:56
    Representatives so if a northerner who
    10:58
    is in the House wanted to ban slavery
    11:00
    and introduce a bill that would not even
    11:02
    be allowed to be discussed in the House
    11:04
    of Representatives this is eventually a
    11:06
    returned by a very prominent House of
    11:09
    Representative member John Quincy Adams
    11:12
    unsuccessful rebellions in the south
    11:15
    knowing the South many slaves tried to
    11:17
    change their status by rebellion by
    11:19
    rebelling but unfortunately for them
    11:21
    they're very unsuccessful Denmark Vesey
    11:23
    and 80/20 plan the largest ever slave
    11:26
    rebellion this never materialized he and
    11:28
    his followers were hanged and this led
    11:30
    to more strict slave laws in 1831 we
    11:33
    have NAT Turner's rebellion which was a
    11:35
    rebellion of Virginia freed that freed
    11:38
    many slaves and killed whites on
    11:39
    plantations and hundreds of blacks were
    11:41
    killed in retaliation not only those
    11:43
    that were involved in the rebellion but
    11:45
    just random blacks as well and again
    11:49
    just like Denmark the Denmark Vesey
    11:52
    planned rebellion slave laws become
    11:55
    stricter every time there's a slave
    11:56
    rebellion there will be harsher slave
    11:57
    laws now in 1831 NAT Turner's rebellion
    12:00
    coincided at the same time with the
    12:03
    publication of William Lloyd Garrison's
    12:05
    weekly newspaper The Liberator and here
    12:07
    is garrison and this call for the media
    12:10
    and uncompensated and to slavery so he
    12:13
    was an outspoken critic of slavery one
    12:15
    of the harshest ones at the time the
    12:17
    women's rights movement often was
    12:18
    connected to the abolitionist movement
    12:20
    and they hope to achieve greater
    12:21
    equality and you could see this at the
    12:24
    Seneca Falls convention in New York in
    12:25
    1848 this was a women's rights
    12:27
    convention in which people like
    12:28

    hey what's going on a push people we
    00:06
    have key concept 4.2 for you this one is
    00:08
    for the revised 2015 edition the most
    00:12
    up-to-date video you will find on key
    00:14
    concept 4.2 before I begin to shout out
    00:17
    time I get a couple classes a shout-out
    00:18
    mrs. Moore's class from Temecula I hope
    00:21
    I pronounced that correctly

    class as well thank you all for watching
    00:27
    and best of luck to you this year
    00:30
    alright let's take a look at key cuts in
    00:32
    4.2 it states innovations in technology
    00:34
    agriculture and commerce powerfully
    00:36
    accelerated the American economy
    00:39
    precipitating profound changes to US
    00:41
    society into national and regional
    00:44
    identities that is from page 47 of the
    00:47
    curriculum framework couple of big idea
    00:49
    questions to think about as we watch
    00:52
    this video 1 how did the market
    00:54
    revolution revolutionize the production
    00:56
    of goods and transform or change gender
    00:59
    and family roles and how did new
    01:02
    inventions transform the production of
    01:04
    goods that to me is screaming like a
    01:06
    short answer question new inventions in
    01:09
    their impact cake has a 4.2 Roman
    01:12
    numeral 1 States new transportation
    01:13
    systems and technologies dramatically
    01:15
    expanded manufacturing and agricultural
    01:18
    production so let's talk about what the
    01:20
    heck the market revolution is is
    01:22
    revolution transportation communication
    01:24
    and the production of goods what is the
    01:27
    impact of this well we have manufactured
    01:28
    goods become more organized and we've
    01:31
    the emergence of factory systems such as
    01:33
    the Lowell factory system in Lowell
    01:36
    Massachusetts in which saw young single
    01:38
    women work in factories so this is
    01:41
    important we increasingly see the
    01:42
    production of goods going from homes to
    01:45
    factories let's jump into some new
    01:47
    innovations but before we do I want to
    01:49
    let you know I do have a video in the
    01:50
    description that goes over these in
    01:52
    detail so for textile machinery we have
    01:54
    things like the spinning jenny and
    01:56
    Samuel Slater was this really important
    01:58
    dude from England who disguises himself
    02:00
    and he sneaks out the country comes to
    02:02
    America
    02:02
    these notice of the father of the
    02:04
    American factory system because he
    02:06
    memorized plans for a spinning jenny and
    02:08
    also helped build factories in the
    02:10
    united states interchangeable parts by
    02:12
    Eli winning this led to
    02:13
    mass production of goods because all the
    02:15
    parts were identical and could be easily
    02:18
    replaced if broken the Telegraph helps
    02:21
    spread information across the country
    02:22
    via Morse code and we have agricultural
    02:25
    inventions you should be familiar with
    02:26
    such as the steel plow by this dude John
    02:28
    Deere this would break soil and allow
    02:30
    farmers to plant crops more easily the
    02:34
    McCormick Reaper allowed them to harvest
    02:36
    crops more easily when they were done
    02:38
    growing and the cotton gin is well also
    02:41
    invented by Eli Whitney we have him
    02:43
    again this was used to separate seeds
    02:45
    from the cotton and this drastically
    02:47
    increased the demand for not only cotton
    02:49
    but slavery as well it really doesn't
    02:52
    matter which one of these inventions
    02:53
    were talking about they all increase
    02:55
    production efficiency so cotton is being
    02:58
    produced a much more efficient rate
    03:00
    manufactured goods are because of
    03:02
    interchangeable parts the development of
    03:05
    infrastructure is huge during this time
    03:07
    in American history we have roads such
    03:09
    as the Cumberland Road which originally
    03:10
    connected Cumberland Maryland to Ohio
    03:13
    and then is extended as far as Illinois
    03:16
    later on and this was paid for by the
    03:18
    federal government because this involves
    03:20
    interstate commerce or trade between two
    03:23
    or more states as an example of an
    03:26
    interstate improvement canals
    03:28
    specifically the Erie Canal which
    03:30
    connected Albany to Buffalo and really
    03:32
    New York City via the Hudson River as
    03:33
    well this was paid for entirely by New
    03:35
    York State because this is an example of
    03:37
    intrastate trade or trade only within
    03:39
    one single State railroads would be an
    03:42
    over arrow this is what the first
    03:43
    railroads it connected Baltimore to Ohio
    03:45
    and many others would spring up
    03:47
    throughout throughout the country as the
    03:49
    years went on and many of these projects
    03:51
    were paid for by state and local
    03:53
    governments not the federal government's
    03:56
    money these were paid for by state and
    03:57
    local and private corporations as well
    03:59
    so what is the impact of all this well
    04:01
    we see that two regions in particular
    04:04
    the north and the Midwest they will be
    04:05
    more closely connected than the south
    04:08
    the south will really kind of be left up
    04:09
    because they're so focused on
    04:10
    plantations and the north and the
    04:13
    Midwest will be will be the
    04:14
    beneficiaries of this infrastructure
    04:17
    okay let's jump over to Roman numeral
    04:19
    two four key cuts at four point two the
    04:21
    changes caused by the market revolution
    04:23
    had significant effects on the u.s.
    04:24
    society workers
    04:26
    lives and gender and family relations so
    04:29
    we see a shift from subsistence farming
    04:31
    or farming just to feed yourself now
    04:33
    people begin to farm to sell crops at
    04:36
    massive rates not just cash crops like
    04:38
    cotton but food as well more men and
    04:41
    women begin to work in factories no
    04:43
    longer just in the homes were a lot of
    04:44
    goods were produced I talked about
    04:46
    earlier and early factories were built
    04:48
    near water here is Lowell Massachusetts
    04:50
    which at one time was the second most
    04:52
    powerful manufacturing city really in
    04:54
    the entire world and it's important
    04:56
    during the cent that factories are built
    04:57
    near water as a source of power for the
    04:59
    machines and they would produce goods
    05:01
    for distant markets not only in the
    05:03
    United States but in various parts of
    05:05
    the world as well what's impact in
    05:08
    manufacturing and the market revolution
    05:09
    well we have a growing middle class we
    05:12
    also have a widening gap between the
    05:14
    rich and the poor we have very few
    05:16
    people who have a lot of money we have
    05:17
    this growing group of poor people as
    05:20
    well there's also a change in gender and
    05:22
    family roles middle-class women the
    05:24
    expectation was that they would not work
    05:26
    outside the home and this was held up by
    05:29
    the city of the cult of domesticity this
    05:30
    promoted separate spheres for men and
    05:33
    women and really a woman sphere belongs
    05:34
    at home not outside the home in work and
    05:37
    here is a magazine Gotti's ladybug
    05:40
    throughout the the 19th century that
    05:42
    really helped reinforce this idea of the
    05:44
    cult of domesticity okay we'll finish up
    05:46
    a four point two Roman numeral three
    05:47
    economic development shape settlements
    05:49
    settlement and trade patterns helping to
    05:52
    unify the nation while also encouraging
    05:53
    the growth of different regions so we
    05:56
    see a wave of immigrants coming in from
    05:57
    Europe and they tended to settle in the
    05:59
    East and the Midwest and there's two
    06:01
    groups in particular you should be
    06:02
    familiar with and we'll talk more about
    06:03
    them in period five but we'll introduce
    06:05
    them here and as a result of these
    06:07
    groups we see increased interdependence
    06:09
    between the Northeast and the Old
    06:11
    Northwest because Germans would send on
    06:14
    the old Northwest at in the frontier in
    06:17
    places like Ohio as farmers in the Irish
    06:20
    they would settle in the east and cities
    06:22
    as urban workers so we really see a
    06:25
    connection between the East and the the
    06:27
    Midwest of the Old Northwest a Metis
    06:30
    Irish escaped Ireland in the 1840s and
    06:32
    1850s because of the Irish potato famine
    06:35
    and this forced many Irish to flee
    06:38
    Ireland
    06:39
    and many died in Ireland as well new
    06:42
    cities began to emerge along the Ohio
    06:44
    and Mississippi River cities such as st.
    06:46
    Louis and Cincinnati in Cincinnati's and
    06:49
    nickname was porkopolis and here is an
    06:50
    early painting of Cincinnati my favorite
    06:53
    city
    06:53
    they became centers for meatpacking then
    06:56
    later on Chicago will as well but a lot
    06:58
    of cities begin to develop along these
    06:59
    very powerful popular rivers so we see
    07:03
    this emergence of national ties between
    07:05
    the north and the south cotton
    07:07
    production and the south is enormous and
    07:10
    this would be shipped to northern
    07:11
    factories and made into different
    07:13
    textiles banks would provide funding for
    07:15
    both factories and plantations in the
    07:18
    south as well as equipment for
    07:19
    plantations and then we have the
    07:21
    emergence of a distinctive Southern
    07:23
    identity the South continued to rely on
    07:25
    cash crops so much so that the South's
    07:27
    nickname was king cotton because they
    07:29
    produce so much cotton and they made so
    07:31
    much money from it plantation owners had
    07:33
    tremendous power both economically and
    07:35
    politically as well and they made sure
    07:37
    that their own interests were advanced
    07:38
    and many elites defended slavery john c
    07:41
    calhoun he gave a speech in 1837 which
    07:45
    he identified slavery as a positive good
    07:47
    in hierarchy that was positive for the
    07:49
    slaves and these are arguments that the
    07:51
    south use to justify slavery there were
    07:55
    hopes to unify the US economy most
    07:57
    notably Henry Clay's American system I
    07:59
    do have a video in the description of
    08:00
    that on there three parts is the second
    08:02
    bank of the United States building up
    08:04
    infrastructure through roads and canals
    08:06
    as we've talked about and that would be
    08:08
    funded by tariffs and tariffs our taxes
    08:11
    on imported goods and what this does is
    08:13
    it tends to be favored by people in the
    08:15
    north in the Midwest and not the south
    08:17
    so just like the market revolution and
    08:19
    an infrastructure tends to benefit the
    08:21
    north and the Midwest more than the
    08:23
    south the American system is the same
    08:25
    and the South in particular will dislike
    08:28
    the American system because of tariffs
    08:30
    that benefited industry and not
    08:32
    agriculture all right we'll finish up
    08:34
    with some tests tips for multiple choice
    08:35
    and short answer be able to identify and
    08:38
    explain the impact of the market
    08:39
    revolution the impact on wealth in this
    08:42
    country the growing gap between the rich
    08:43
    and poor as well as gender and family
    08:45
    roles and the impact of technology and
    08:47
    industry and agriculture and goals of
    08:50
    the Americans goals and impacts of the
    08:52
    American
    08:53
    system for essay questions it could be
    08:55
    about the market revolution in general
    08:57
    and reasons for sectional tensions and
    08:59
    the emerge of unique regional identities

    forward to see ray back here for key

    interest in increasing foreign trade in

    expanding its national borders shape the
    00:37

    00:41
    that's from page 50 if you haven't

    downloaded this yet check in link in the
    00:45
    description you need to know this so
    00:47
    it's a big idea questions you should be
    00:48
    able to answer at the conclusion of this
    00:50
    video what was the message of an impact
    00:53
    of the Monroe Doctrine and how did
    00:55
    westward expansion lead to conflicts
    00:58
    over slavery that will be a theme
    01:00
    continuing into period 5 as well make
    01:03
    sure you know that and understand it
    01:05
    right he cuts up four point three Roman
    01:07
    numeral one struggling to create an
    01:09
    independent global presence the United
    01:11
    States sought to clean territory
    01:12
    throughout the North American continent
    01:14
    and promote foreign trade that is also
    01:16
    from page 50 so what we'll see is that
    01:18
    after the Louisiana Purchase the US will
    01:20
    seek to increase its influence in North
    01:22
    America through the following ways with
    01:25
    exploration right after a few years
    01:27
    after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 we
    01:29
    have the Lewis and Clark expedition in
    01:31
    Lewis and Clark were aides to Jefferson
    01:33
    and they sought to find a waterway to
    01:35
    this Pacific Ocean obviously they never
    01:38
    found that but they did gain immense
    01:40
    knowledge about the environment and
    01:41
    natives on the land they just purchased
    01:44
    from the French military actions were
    01:48
    another way to increase influence we
    01:49
    have their roost ik war which settled
    01:51
    the main Canada boundary dispute so our
    01:54
    present-day boundaries between Maine and
    01:56
    Canada were established as a result of
    01:58
    this in the 1830s we have American
    02:00
    Indian Removal as well the Indian
    02:02
    Removal Act of 1830 which led to later
    02:05
    the Trail of Tears which forced many
    02:07
    natives to move west of the Mississippi
    02:09
    River and here is a map of the
    02:11
    the forced removal Native Americans to
    02:14
    go beyond the Mississippi River into
    02:17
    present-day Oklahoma
    02:19
    there were diplomatic efforts as well
    02:21
    specifically the Monroe Doctrine which
    02:23
    warned Europe to stay out of the Western
    02:25
    Hemisphere President James Monroe
    02:27
    through the Monroe Doctrine basically
    02:29
    said Europe you guys have a different
    02:31
    government than us you are not to try to
    02:33
    recolonize any of these newly
    02:35
    independent nations in latin america and
    02:38
    you need to stay out of the western
    02:39
    hemisphere and in return the United
    02:42
    States would stay out of European
    02:43
    affairs and here's a great political
    02:45
    cartoon that illustrates the Monroe
    02:47
    Doctrine you'll notice that the US
    02:49
    according to this cartoon has Uncle
    02:52
    Sam's hat right in Latin America so this
    02:54
    will increase the USA's involvement in
    02:56
    Latin America for in years to come as we
    02:59
    shall see those that were living on the
    03:01
    frontier tended to favor expansion those
    03:04
    Americans and this would allow for more
    03:06
    land to be available for farming now
    03:08
    with expansion comes resistance by
    03:10
    Native Americans we have the Black Hawk
    03:12
    War which was in Illinois in 1832 and
    03:15
    Abe Lincoln was actually part of this
    03:17
    although he did not see any combat
    03:19
    Native Americans they sought to gain
    03:21
    land that they ceded to the government
    03:23
    the US government in 1804 back they were
    03:26
    unsuccessful in the Seminole Wars this
    03:29
    was a series of wars in the early to mid
    03:31
    nineteenth century the first Seminole
    03:33
    war forced natives for Seminole natives
    03:36
    of Florida to move to Central Florida
    03:38
    and then the second one will see the
    03:40
    removal of the Seminoles from Florida so
    03:43
    we see here where the u.s. is expanding
    03:45
    there will be many calls for from
    03:47
    Americans to remove Native Americans
    03:49
    from this land Cocozza four point three
    03:52
    Roman numeral two states the United
    03:54
    States acquisition of lands in the West
    03:56
    gave rise to contests over the extension
    03:59
    of slavery into new territories so
    04:01
    there's a spread of the plantation
    04:03
    slavery
    04:04
    west of the Appalachian Mountains now
    04:06
    let's think back we first were
    04:08
    introduced to the Appalachian Mountains
    04:10
    in 1763 do you remember why they were so
    04:13
    important in 1763 you know this that's
    04:16
    right the proclamation line of 1763
    04:18
    which the British government said the
    04:20
    colonists could not expand West a very
    04:22
    good nice memory
    04:23
    so the deep south refers also known as
    04:26
    the condo this refers to new states like
    04:28
    Mississippi Alabama Louisiana which had
    04:31
    a lot of fertile soil for the production
    04:33
    of cotton many slaveholders began to
    04:37
    move to more fertile land west of
    04:39
    Appalachians because cotton similar to
    04:41
    tobacco from colonial days that
    04:43
    exhausted the land it destroyed the land
    04:45
    there's a constant need for new fertile
    04:48
    soil now during this time we begin to
    04:50
    see anti-slavery efforts increase in the
    04:52
    north and it's important to note that
    04:53
    women's rights in abolitionism were
    04:55
    closely linked those two reform
    04:57
    movements were very very closely linked
    04:59
    I can't stress enough you need to know
    05:01
    that an example is lydia maria child she
    05:04
    was an abolitionist and a women's rights
    05:06
    advocate we also have a very well-known
    05:09
    author from New England William Lloyd
    05:11
    Garrison who published a weekly
    05:12
    newspaper from 1831 to 1865 called the
    05:16
    Liberator and this advocated the
    05:19
    immediate and uncompensated end to
    05:21
    slavery he wanted slavery to end now
    05:24
    today this moment and slave owners he
    05:27
    believes should not be paid or
    05:28
    compensated for the loss of their slaves
    05:31
    now jump on over to slavery in the south
    05:34
    and three out of four people in the
    05:36
    south did not own slaves however the
    05:38
    institution was very prolific down in
    05:41
    the South slavery was defended by many
    05:43
    southern leaders and writers we talked
    05:45
    about key concept four point two video
    05:47
    this guy dracula i mean john c calhoun
    05:50
    argued that slavery was a positive good
    05:52
    a very well known writer George Fitzhugh
    05:54
    would write about slavery in terms of
    05:56
    being better than factory workers in the
    05:58
    north so a lot of people in the south
    06:00
    began to defend slavery during this time
    06:02
    and actually called it a good or
    06:04
    positive thing the Missouri Compromise
    06:06
    is also known as the Compromise of 1820
    06:08
    and there are three parts you have to
    06:10
    know all three parts I have a detailed
    06:11
    video as well in this in the description
    06:13
    make sure you check it out one Missouri
    06:16
    would enter the country as a slave state
    06:18
    so there this is the first state carved
    06:20
    out of Louisiana Purchase territory that
    06:22
    wants to enter the United States as a
    06:24
    slave state this would tip the balance
    06:26
    in favor of the slave states so part of
    06:29
    the compromise would allow for Maine to
    06:31
    enter the country as a free state Maine
    06:33
    once belonged to Massachusetts
    06:35
    now it's its own state and is
    06:37
    emerging as a free state then we also
    06:40
    have this line known as a 36:30 line and
    06:42
    it is right here below Missouri
    06:46
    everything above this in the future all
    06:48
    this green territory over here would be
    06:50
    emitted as free everything below it down
    06:53
    here would be mid emitted as slave
    06:56
    states this is the third part of the
    06:58
    compromise now eventually we'll find out
    07:00
    period five this this gets overturned
    07:02
    now the impact is attention still
    07:05
    existed there's it was a temporary
    07:06
    solution between defenders and
    07:08
    supporters of slavery people like Thomas
    07:10
    Jefferson absolutely hated the Missouri
    07:12
    Compromise
    07:13
    he talks about it this geographical line
    07:16
    will never be obliterated and every new
    07:19
    irritation will mark it deeper and
    07:21
    deeper so he was arguing that this will
    07:23
    divide the north and the south and he
    07:26
    was right then the 1850s tensions would
    07:28
    come to the forefront we'll eventually
    07:29
    see the Missouri Compromise is repealed
    07:32
    but it was a temporary solution to the
    07:34
    issue of slavery in the territories okay
    07:38
    let's go over some test steps worried
    07:39
    for multiple choice and short answer be
    07:42
    able to identify and explain examples of
    07:44
    us seeking dominance in North America
    07:46
    and the Western Hemisphere the Monroe
    07:48
    Doctrine and the removal of Native
    07:50
    Americans as well conflicts with Native
    07:52
    Americans be able to identify and
    07:54
    describe one of them one or two of them
    07:56
    the Missouri Compromise absolutely know
    07:58
    all three parts and that it was a
    08:00
    temporary solution and four essay
    08:02
    questions what were the impacts of
    08:04
    westward expansion on natives and on
    08:06
    tensions between the north and the south
    08:08
    which of course would include slavery
    08:10
    all right guys look forward to seeing
    08:12
    right back here four key concept five
    08:14
    point one in which we will talk about
    08:16
    manifest destiny very important topic
    08:18
    that will help lead to this civil war I
    08:21
    thank you guys very much for watching
    08:23
    and have a good day

    what's up a.push peeps we have the
    00:32
    second party system this is going to be
    00:34
    a Jackson and Henry Clay centred video
    00:37
    and this is a very important part of the
    00:40
    new a.push curriculum this to me screams
    00:43
    a short answer question so make sure you
    00:45
    are familiar with it all right so let's
    00:48
    all talk about the 1820s 1830s we have
    00:50
    the rise of new political party
    00:52
    specifically the Whigs led by Henry Clay
    00:54
    that's going to be in the 1830s and the
    00:56
    Democrats in the 1820s led by Andrew
    00:58
    Jackson now this time saw increased
    01:01
    political participation you see this
    01:04
    through the elimination of property
    01:05
    requirements for adult white male so you
    01:08
    do see a large number of adult white
    01:10
    males voting that's the increase of
    01:12
    political participation but of course we
    01:14
    still have a large portion of the
    01:16
    American population that can not vote
    01:18
    African Americans women now the
    01:21
    differences between the two parties that
    01:22
    you should know is that their debates
    01:24
    over the role and power of the federal
    01:26
    government should the federal government
    01:28
    be strong should it be weak the National
    01:31
    Bank or the second bet boss or the Bank
    01:33
    of the United States this was a huge
    01:35
    issue between these two also tariffs or
    01:38
    taxes on imported goods and federally
    01:40
    funded internal improvements or the
    01:43
    federal government pain for
    01:44
    infrastructure now the last three here
    01:47
    this is really going to be Henry Clay's
    01:49
    American system so what we'll find is
    01:52
    that the Whigs generally support these
    01:54
    three things and the Democrats generally
    01:56
    are against these three things so it's
    01:59
    about the role and power of the federal
    02:01
    government Whigs tended to favor a
    02:02
    stronger central government and they
    02:04
    would support Henry Clay's American
    02:06
    system the National Boss internal
    02:08
    improvements and the protective tariffs
    02:10
    again make sure you know all three parts
    02:13
    of the American system I do have a video
    02:16
    in the description of the American
    02:17
    system check it out if you want more
    02:19
    info Democrats they tended to favor more
    02:22
    power to four states and they would
    02:24
    oppose the American system so that's one
    02:26
    major difference between the two parties
    02:28
    the National Bank or the second bus
    02:31
    Andrew Jackson he's going to veto a
    02:35
    recharter of this I could bus which
    02:37
    would essentially be the third one in
    02:38
    1832 and this is going to lead to some
    02:40
    called the bank warned I do have a video
    02:42
    on that as well now the wigs Henry Clay
    02:45
    they're going to really join in crew
    02:46
    they're going to create this new
    02:47
    political party the Whigs in response to
    02:51
    what they called King Andrew the
    02:52
    firstness is a very famous political
    02:54
    cartoon because what's unique about this
    02:56
    is adrianne vetoed the bus and this was
    02:59
    the first time a president vetoed
    03:01
    something because he didn't like it not
    03:04
    because he thought it was
    03:05
    unconstitutional he vetoed it because he
    03:07
    personally did not like it and you see
    03:09
    here in his left hand he has a veto in
    03:12
    there and many people thought that he
    03:15
    was abusing his power so key questions
    03:18
    you should ask yourself anytime you see
    03:20
    a political cartoon is who would agree
    03:22
    with this who would disagree with this
    03:24
    so obviously the creator of this cartoon
    03:26
    would most likely sympathize with the
    03:29
    Whigs and would not sympathize with the
    03:32
    Democrats so maybe a northern banker
    03:35
    would love this cartoon because it is
    03:37
    criticizing Andrew Jackson but maybe a
    03:40
    farmer who was refused a loan by the
    03:42
    Bank of the United States would disagree
    03:45
    with this because they thought Andrew
    03:48
    Jackson was good for killing the bus all
    03:51
    right let's jump on over to tariffs
    03:52
    tariffs are a tax on imported goods they
    03:54
    tended to be favored in the north and by
    03:56
    industries and disliked by the South
    03:58
    because tariffs tended to protect
    03:59
    businesses in the north Whigs tended to
    04:02
    support them and Democrats did not you
    04:04
    could already tell that because of the
    04:06
    American system tariff of 1828 and 1832
    04:09
    work were really hot bed topics during
    04:13
    this time they were high tariff rates
    04:15
    and Dracula who was the vice president I
    04:18
    mean John C Calhoun who was the vice
    04:19
    president to Andrew Jackson he was from
    04:21
    South Carolina and he wrote the South
    04:23
    Carolina exposition in protests he was
    04:25
    against these high tariffs and look at
    04:28
    him yet you see the resemblance there
    04:29
    it's identical so in 1833 we have a
    04:31
    compromise tariff of 1833 in which the
    04:34
    tariff rates are lowered over eight
    04:36
    years and that is the second of three
    04:38
    major compromises by Henry Clay really
    04:41
    the country was close to Civil War
    04:43
    during this time let's jump on over to
    04:45
    federally funded internal improvement is
    04:47
    a key component of Henry Clay's American
    04:49
    system this means that the federal
    04:52
    government would pay for infrastructure
    04:54
    actually when it came to states in it
    04:57
    and there were debates over whether the
    04:59
    federal government should fund
    05:00
    intrastate or one state improvement
    05:03
    Henry Clay favored that people who were
    05:05
    against this did not they thought the
    05:07
    federal government should only pay for
    05:08
    improvements that would benefit more
    05:11
    than one state or interstate commerce
    05:13
    so Andrew Jackson he will veto the
    05:17
    Maysville Road bill which would provide
    05:19
    federal funds for a road that is solely
    05:22
    in Kentucky and many Whigs were upset
    05:26
    about this so Jackson is pretty much
    05:28
    like sorry bro no improvements for you
    05:29
    because you are Kentucky you are one
    05:31
    state that's intra not interstate
    05:34
    commerce alright let's finish up with
    05:36
    some tests tips for multiple choice and
    05:37
    short answer no the causes of the rise
    05:40
    of the second party system I could see
    05:42
    this as a short answer question
    05:45
    differences between the two parties what
    05:47
    are they who would support them
    05:48
    characteristics of supporters and for
    05:50
    essays almost any essay in the
    05:52
    antebellum time period you could fit
    05:53
    these political parties into it and a
    05:56
    possible synthesis point could be
    05:58
    connecting this to debates during the
    05:59
    first party system so for example there
    06:02
    were debates about the bank of the
    06:03
    United States during the second party
    06:05
    system as there were in the first party
    06:08
    system short answer question I will
    06:10
    leave you with and you would answer all
    06:12
    three parts briefly explain how one of
    06:14
    the following was most significant in
    06:16
    the formation of political parties in
    06:18
    the early 19th century again Whigs and
    06:20
    Democrats National Bank tariffs
    06:22
    federally funded internal improvements
    06:24
    ladies gentleman this is straight from
    06:25
    the new curriculum so you could see a
    06:27
    short answer question like this provide
    06:29
    one piece of historical evidence that
    06:31
    supports your choice in Part A and
    06:34
    briefly explain why one of the other
    06:36
    options is not as significant in the
    06:39
    formation of political parties in the
    06:40
    early 19th century so you have to create
    06:42
    an argument as to why one is a
    06:45
    significant cause for the creation of
    06:47
    parties and one of these is not as
    06:49
    significant all right guys thank you

    Oh what's going down a push peeps we
    00:06
    have a quick video for you today but a
    00:07
    very important one this one is going to
    00:09
    focus on technology and transportation
    00:11
    during the market revolution things that
    00:14
    are specifically mentioned in the new
    00:16
    curriculum so make sure you are familiar
    00:18
    with it before you begin its shout out
    00:20
    time shout out to several classes we mr.

    00:26
    mr. Barnes class from OPI and missus
    00:29

    the support I can't tell you how much it
    00:33
    means to me and best of luck to you all
    00:35
    this year as well as everybody watching
    00:38
    you want to shout out for your teacher
    00:39
    leave it in the comment section below
    00:42
    alright let's start off talking about
    00:43
    what the heck is the market revolution
    00:44
    well it's a revolution in transportation
    00:46
    farming and production of goods we see
    00:50
    an increased use of canals roads stoom
    00:52
    steamboats and railroads during this
    00:54
    time we also see a switch from
    00:56
    subsistence to cash crop farming so no
    00:59
    longer are people growing food just to
    01:01
    survive off of they're growing it to
    01:03
    sell and we also see that group goods
    01:06
    are produced increasingly outside the
    01:08
    home so we begin to see a switch towards
    01:11
    factories and this occurs prior to the
    01:13
    Civil War which is antebellum America
    01:16
    the word Antebellum means prior to the
    01:19
    Civil War okay let's talk about some
    01:20
    transportation improvements for roads we
    01:23
    have the Cumberland or the National Road
    01:25
    and it originally went from Maryland all
    01:29
    the way over to Ohio knit since was
    01:31
    added on a lot more stretching all the
    01:33
    way over to Illinois and this was funded
    01:35
    by the federal government because it
    01:37
    connected two or more states and that's
    01:39
    an example of interstate so the federal
    01:42
    government it's going to be lots of
    01:43
    debates during this time should the
    01:44
    federal government provide funding for
    01:46
    transportation the federal government
    01:49
    will if it's an example of inter or two
    01:51
    or more states so if it's just one state
    01:53
    that benefits from it chances are the
    01:55
    government will not but if it's many
    01:57
    states that benefit two or more than
    01:59
    they will an example of an intrastate
    02:03
    project is the Erie Canal we see lots of
    02:06
    canals popping up but none that are more
    02:08
    important during this time than the Erie
    02:09
    Canal is 363 miles long and it connected
    02:13
    Albany to Buffalo and here is the city
    02:16
    of Lockport near Buffalo it's about 20
    02:18
    minutes from my house here is a
    02:19
    depiction of Lockport named after the
    02:22
    locks on the canal this was paid
    02:24
    entirely by New York State because this
    02:26
    is intrastate is within one state the
    02:29
    original plan called for the federal
    02:31
    government to fund it in James Monroe
    02:34
    vetoed it because it was only within the
    02:37
    state he thought it was unconstitutional
    02:38
    now eventually there a canal is going to
    02:40
    connect New York City via the Hudson
    02:42
    River all the way over to the Midwest
    02:45
    another improvement transportation we
    02:47
    have is the steamboat and here is a
    02:49
    replica of one of the first steamboats
    02:50
    and it was really became popular due to
    02:53
    Robert Fulton and there's a lot of boats
    02:55
    to travel against the current no longer
    02:58
    did they have to go downstream with
    03:00
    whatever direction the current went now
    03:01
    they could travel against and goods it
    03:03
    can be shipped in multiple directions
    03:05
    alright let's jump over to agricultural
    03:08
    improvements we have the cotton gin
    03:09
    invented by Eli Whitney and this
    03:12
    drastically increased cotton production
    03:14
    and the demand for slaves in the south
    03:16
    and what the cotton gin does is kind of
    03:18
    has these seeds in it and you would put
    03:20
    the cognate here this machine would
    03:22
    separate the seeds from the cotton
    03:24
    itself and what we see is this gigantic
    03:28
    explosion and the demand for cotton in
    03:30
    the amount of cotton that is produced
    03:32
    this steel plow is amended by this dude
    03:35
    John Deere this allowed farmers to break
    03:38
    soil more easily and begin planting and
    03:40
    this is especially beneficial to farmers
    03:42
    in the Midwest who would focus on
    03:44
    growing wheat another invention is the
    03:47
    McCormick Reaper and here is an
    03:48
    illustration of it and farmers could
    03:50
    harvest crops more quickly and the key
    03:53
    thing to think with all these inventions
    03:54
    inventions is that efficiency is going
    03:57
    to increase for the McCormick Reaper the
    04:00
    efficiency of harvesting will increase
    04:02
    for farmers drastically alright let's
    04:05
    jump over to technological improvements
    04:07
    interchangeable parts we have Eli
    04:08
    Whitney again here he is he is really
    04:10
    credited with interchangeable parts and
    04:13
    what this does is creates cookie-cutter
    04:15
    parts I use this analogy if I ask you to
    04:17
    make a star shaped cookie you're star
    04:20
    shaped cookie may look a lot different
    04:22
    from mine when an interchangeable part
    04:24
    does is it makes all of these look ident
    04:26
    so if I give you a star shaped cookie
    04:29
    cutter all of your cookies would look
    04:31
    the same so this will allow goods to be
    04:34
    produced with identical parts and this
    04:36
    leads to the mass production of goods in
    04:38
    increased production and efficiency
    04:40
    rates especially for things like guns
    04:43
    and other forms of manufactured goods we
    04:47
    have the Telegraph which was used to
    04:49
    communicate Morse code in here Samuel
    04:51
    Morse and in 1844 we have the first
    04:53
    transmission and the first transmission
    04:55
    said what hath God wrought and that is
    04:58
    also the name of a Pulitzer
    04:59
    prize-winning book I suggest you check
    05:02
    out that's all about this time period
    05:03
    and this drastically increased
    05:05
    communication in the United States so
    05:07
    information is spread much faster that
    05:09
    will play a very important role during
    05:11
    the Civil War generals can now
    05:13
    communicate with Abe Lincoln in the
    05:14
    White House and transmit information
    05:16
    quickly all right let's go over some
    05:19
    test steps for multiple choices short
    05:20
    answer no specific inventions and be
    05:23
    able to explain the impact especially by
    05:26
    the region so know that the cotton gin
    05:28
    for example at a drastic impact on the
    05:31
    south especially as manifest destiny is
    05:33
    occurring in the u.s. is expanding
    05:35
    though the interchangeable parts will
    05:37
    have a large impact on the north and
    05:39
    factory for essay topics this could be a
    05:41
    part of a broader essay about the market
    05:44
    revolution and regional specialization
    05:46
    again what inventions benefit the north
    05:48
    been to the south and benefited the west
    05:51
    all right guys thank you very much for
    05:52
    watching I do appreciate hopefully you
    05:54

    05:56

    05:58

    06:00

    00:03
    hey what's up ap guys we have a video
    00:06
    for you on the Nullification Crisis
    00:07
    which occurs during Andrew Jackson's
    00:09
    presidencies one of my favorite times in
    00:12
    US history before we get started I want
    00:14
    to introduce you to a quote I read by
    00:17
    Andrew Jackson while reading this
    00:19
    wonderful book on my political hero
    00:21
    Henry Clay statesman for the Union by
    00:23
    renowned a Jackson scholar Robert Remini
    00:27
    and the very first page I saw this quote
    00:30
    and here's Andrew Jackson when he was
    00:33
    close to his death he was asked if he
    00:35
    had left anything undone
    00:37
    yes Jackson replied I didn't shoot Henry
    00:41
    Clay and I didn't hang John C Calhoun
    00:44
    those are some strong words there for
    00:46
    edge Jackson now much of his resentment
    00:48
    towards Henry Clay started with the
    00:50
    corrupt bargain and virtually all of his
    00:53
    resentment towards John C Cajon can be
    00:55
    traced back to this let's find out what
    00:57
    did John see Calhoun do that may dad
    00:59
    Andrew Jackson want to hang him alright
    01:03
    before we get started with the tariff
    01:05
    controversy we need to do a brief review
    01:07
    of tariffs and remember a tariff is a
    01:10
    tax on foreign goods now what a tariff
    01:13
    does is it raises the price of foreign
    01:16
    made products and in theory this will
    01:18
    help out with American businesses
    01:20
    because now foreign products are more
    01:22
    expensive it also will provide a source
    01:25
    of revenue for the government who would
    01:27
    favor tariffs well the Northwood because
    01:30
    they have industry and that's where a
    01:31
    lot of manufacturing takes place and
    01:33
    those that would be against tariffs
    01:35
    would be the south and then some people
    01:37
    in the West as well there's little
    01:39
    industry and they are consumers so they
    01:41
    would be hurt by these high prices okay
    01:45
    let's go to the tariff of 1828 also
    01:47
    known as the tariff of abominations this
    01:49
    is passed in 1828 and hopes to hurt
    01:51
    President Adams this was actually
    01:53
    devised by a bunch of jacks Jackson
    01:56
    supporters who they wanted a turf to be
    01:58
    so high that President John Adams would
    02:00
    have to veto it and if he vetoed it that
    02:02
    he would alienate his base in the north
    02:05
    thus guaranteeing the election the
    02:08
    presidential election of 1828 two jacks
    02:10
    and however Adam signs it he does
    02:12
    alienate himself in
    02:13
    South in the West but he keeps that base
    02:16
    in the north and this raises tariff
    02:18
    rates significantly let's take a look at
    02:21
    this we have way up here is the tariff
    02:24
    of 1828 48 percent on some Goods it is
    02:28
    very very high the highest tariffs up to
    02:31
    that time by far again the northern
    02:34
    industries are going to favor this and
    02:35
    the southerners are going to be hurt by
    02:36
    this tariff and the southerners receive
    02:39
    no tariff protection protection for
    02:41
    their goods predominantly cotton so they
    02:44
    felt like why are we getting a bone
    02:46
    thrown our way here enter John C Calhoun
    02:49
    well he is part of the great trial but
    02:50
    here's another great book by Merrill
    02:53
    Petersen and it is all about these three
    02:56
    interesting med but my favorite right
    02:58
    here in the middle
    02:59
    Henry Clay there John Seco who is also
    03:01
    the vice president under both President
    03:03
    Adams and President Jackson so he served
    03:06
    under two different presidents he goes
    03:08
    on to become a senator from South
    03:09
    Carolina he was also a Warhawk leading
    03:11
    to the war of 1812 and a very scary
    03:15
    individual he did not age well
    03:16
    whatsoever he kind of looks like Dracula
    03:18
    or something I don't know know somebody
    03:20
    in the Airness he looks like doctor I'm
    03:22
    a brown I don't agree but by the way
    03:23
    that is my favorite movie of all time
    03:25
    maybe you see the resemblance I don't
    03:27
    Ron for a Marty okay he also wrote a a
    03:31
    pamphlet called the South Carolina
    03:33
    exposition and protest very important to
    03:36
    know he wrote this anonymously while he
    03:39
    was vice president he drew inspiration
    03:40
    from the Virginia and Kentucky
    03:42
    resolutions and what he said in this was
    03:45
    for states to nullify the tariff of
    03:47
    abominations for the tariff of 1828 two
    03:52
    years later in 1830 in the Senate we
    03:54
    have something called that Webster hain
    03:55
    debate which which is very very symbolic
    03:58
    and very very important at this time
    03:59
    Daniel Webster also part of the great
    04:02
    triumvirate supported the Union it was
    04:04
    critical of cries of secession hain here
    04:07
    who goes on who goes on to become
    04:09
    governor of South Carolina was buddies
    04:11
    with John C Calhoun and he was
    04:12
    encouraging people to nullify the
    04:14
    tariffs and then they were even some
    04:16
    some chants of secession here breaking
    04:19
    away and Webster was notorious for
    04:22
    wanting to preserve the Union and this
    04:24
    is a very very famous debate that will
    04:26
    unite the door
    04:27
    for many years to come here we have the
    04:30
    tariff of 1832 and this lowered the
    04:33
    rates from the tariff of abominations
    04:34
    how why were the sounds like nope still
    04:37
    too high bro you gotta lower them even
    04:38
    more so South Carolina calls a state
    04:40
    convention and they officially know if
    04:42
    either tariff of 1832 it and this sets
    04:45
    the stage for a showdown nullification a
    04:48
    reminder is the act of making something
    04:50
    void specifically the action of a state
    04:52
    in
    04:53
    abrogating a federal law on the basis of
    04:56
    state sovereignty in other words a state
    04:58
    nullifying or declaring a federal law
    05:01
    unconstitutional in South Carolina in
    05:04
    addition to nullify net said to Jackson
    05:06
    in Washington DC hey if you try to
    05:08
    collect these tariffs we will break away
    05:10
    we will threaten secession they threaten
    05:13
    secession so a hero is needed and who is
    05:17
    going to come save the day oh my god it
    05:20
    is super clay rhyme that was pretty done
    05:23
    so this is the great compromisers second
    05:26
    compromise and this is known as a
    05:28
    compromise tariff of 1833 so over the
    05:31
    next eight years the tariff rates will
    05:33
    gradually lower by ten percent per year
    05:36
    so if we look back at this chart you see
    05:39
    that each one of these little steps here
    05:41
    is the rate lowering ten percent per
    05:44
    year and you see 33 34 35 36 those are
    05:48
    the year so 10% per year and then it's
    05:51
    going to go all the way back to the
    05:53
    tariff of 1816 to the rates of the
    05:57
    tariff of 1816 the south will favor this
    05:59
    and Jackson and the same day that the
    06:02
    tariff of 1833 is passed the force bill
    06:05
    is passed which was introduced by Andrew
    06:07
    Jackson and what the force bill says is
    06:10
    that the president could use the
    06:12
    military to collect tariffs in the
    06:14
    future if necessary so it was a way for
    06:16
    Andrew Jackson to kind of get his way as
    06:18
    well and both Jackson and Calhoun were
    06:21
    able to say faced with this they both
    06:23
    were able to claim victory on some level
    06:25
    the crisis is averted but the real hero
    06:27
    here is Henry Clay alright that's
    06:31
    everything you need to know about the
    06:32
    nullification crisis I hope that helped
    06:34
    take a moment to subscribe spread the
    06:36
    word for me please let people know in
    06:38

    Finney who was a traveling preacher and

    on this tomorrow when I check your video
    01:01
    guys this influenced reform movements I
    01:04
    can't stress enough the Second Great
    01:05
    Awakening is going to influence a lot of
    01:08
    reform movements make sure you know that
    01:10
    for your tests okay transcendentalism
    01:12
    this is the individual experience focus
    01:15
    on reasoning unreason in understanding
    01:17
    some famous transcendentalist you have
    01:19
    Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote several
    01:23
    writings including nature that
    01:25
    individual should be in harmony with
    01:26
    nature Henry David Thoreau with arguably
    01:29
    the greatest neckbeard in the history of
    01:31
    the United States he authored civil
    01:34
    disobedience and he believed that a
    01:35
    government that violates morality has no
    01:37
    authority and this will go on to inspire
    01:39
    Gandhi and Martin Luther King so very
    01:42
    influential person not only in US
    01:44
    history but world history as well okay
    01:46
    Toby in societies these were communal
    01:49
    societies in the 19th century of Brooke
    01:51
    farm in Massachusetts founded by George
    01:53
    Ripley and community members shared in
    01:56
    the work and in leisure so the Goldie's
    01:59
    can of these utopian societies was to
    02:01
    basically have perfection in little
    02:04
    societies New Harmony founded in Indiana
    02:07
    saw members work and live in equality
    02:10
    including females they had many rights
    02:12
    during that time
    02:14
    jumping on over to temperance now we're
    02:16
    getting into the reform movements that
    02:17
    were inspired by what yeah you genius
    02:20
    there you go again you know it it's a
    02:22
    second Great Awakening this was a
    02:24
    movement to limit the consumption of
    02:25
    alcohol especially hard liquor and the
    02:28
    American Temperance Society saw over 1
    02:30
    million members that pledge to abstain
    02:32
    from liquor so this was very popular
    02:35
    during Antebellum or pre-civil war
    02:37
    America Lyman Beecher who was the father
    02:40
    to Harriet Beecher Stowe was a notable
    02:44
    member and there is Lyman Beecher and
    02:45
    we'll talk more about Harriet Beecher
    02:47
    Stowe in another video and in 1851 Maine
    02:49
    past the first dry law in America or the
    02:53
    first law banning alcohol so we'll talk
    02:57
    more about prohibition which is
    02:58
    eliminating all alcohol that really kind
    03:00
    of gets its roots in the temperance
    03:02
    movement of the mid 19th century ok jump
    03:06
    it over to education we got horseman he
    03:08
    is the father of education the dude
    03:10
    looks like a teacher me he's a snazzy
    03:12
    dresser too he believed that education
    03:14
    was important for democracy that you had
    03:16
    to have an educated electorate who would
    03:18
    be able to vote based on knowledge and
    03:22
    tax imported elementary schools gain
    03:24
    support in antebellum America but really
    03:27
    the quality of education was dependent
    03:29
    on where one lived if you were in a
    03:31
    rural area you wouldn't you wouldn't be
    03:34
    as likely to have as good of an
    03:35
    education as somebody who lives in a
    03:37
    more settled community ok asylum and
    03:41
    Prison Reforms we Dorothea Dix she was
    03:43
    instrumental reform for the mentally ill
    03:45
    and providing better treatment for them
    03:47
    debtors back then could be thrown in
    03:49
    jail for not paying off death so if you
    03:51
    had a loan if you couldn't pay it off
    03:54
    then you would be thrown in jail
    03:55
    thankfully that's not the way it is
    03:57
    today and new Penitentiary's were built
    03:59
    the first one in Auburn New York about
    04:01
    two and a half hours for me and these
    04:02
    new penitent trees were built because
    04:04
    old prisons were unsafe and dangerous
    04:06
    some of them were even former mine
    04:08
    shafts so imagine how crazy that had to
    04:11
    be staying in there alright women's
    04:13
    rights we're jumping over to now Seneca
    04:15
    Falls convention of 1848 issued the
    04:17
    Declaration of sentiments which stayed
    04:20
    that all men and women are created equal
    04:23
    Elizabeth Cady Stanton was the only non
    04:25
    Quaker that drafted
    04:26
    the declaration this is important
    04:28
    because if you remember from colonial
    04:29
    America Quakers gave women lots of
    04:32
    rights they were seen as having more
    04:34
    rights than other religions and at the
    04:38
    Seneca Falls convention the members
    04:39
    sought to obtain women's suffrage but
    04:42
    they would not obtain suffrage until
    04:44
    1920 with the 19th amendment ok reform
    04:49
    movements abolitionism I have a video
    04:51
    that details abolitionism so we'll just
    04:53
    kind of summarize it really quickly here
    04:54
    but be familiar with the different
    04:56
    tactics that abolitionists use they use
    04:58
    moral arguments people like Frederick
    05:00
    Douglas in William Lloyd Garrison they
    05:02
    used moral arguments against slavery
    05:04
    there are also people who use violence
    05:06
    such as Nat Turner in John Brown and
    05:09
    then also assisting slaves escapes
    05:11
    through the Underground Railroad most
    05:13
    notably Harriet Tubman pictured here so
    05:15
    be familiar with these three different
    05:18
    tactics that abolitionists use to help
    05:21
    end slavery
    05:22

    00:34
    all right early abolitionism throughout
    00:36
    most of early American history abolition
    00:39
    is primarily consisted of a very small
    00:41
    portion of the population if you're an
    00:44
    abolitionist in the 1700s chances are
    00:46
    you were one of the you belong to more
    00:48
    than five three groups you would be a
    00:50
    free african-american a slave or a
    00:53
    Quaker those are really the main
    00:55
    abolitionists in the 1700s in the 18th
    00:58
    century colonization was a big goal
    01:03
    early on in the abolitionist movement
    01:04
    prior to 1830 many politicians supported
    01:07
    colonization efforts of former slaves in
    01:10
    Africa this included people like Henry
    01:12
    Clay Chief Justice John Marshall and
    01:14
    Daniel Webster in 1816 the
    01:17
    Americanization Society was founded and
    01:19
    it called for gradual emancipation so
    01:22
    slowly freeing slaves and movement of
    01:25
    these former slaves to Africa and
    01:29
    Liberia this country of Liberia on the
    01:31
    west coast of Africa was established as
    01:33
    a place for colonization in its capital
    01:36
    is Monrovia named after President James
    01:38
    Monroe okay now we're getting into some
    01:41
    abolitionists we have David Walker he
    01:44
    was the creator of an appeal to the
    01:45
    colored citizens of the world and he
    01:48
    wanted to mobilize blacks in the
    01:50
    abolitionist movement he was a harsh
    01:52
    critic of colonization and he used the
    01:54
    Bible and Declaration of Independence in
    01:56
    his writings as a criticism of slavery
    02:00
    that Turner and his famous rebellion
    02:03
    this led he led one of the largest slave
    02:05
    rebellions in history in 1831 a very
    02:08
    important year and as well virtually all
    02:10
    slavery by enslaved coats became more
    02:12
    correct afterwards net turner in about a
    02:15
    hundred people were killed as a result
    02:17
    of this labor violence why employ
    02:20
    garrison was the creator of The
    02:21
    Liberator the same years in that
    02:22
    Turner's rebellion in 1831 in it in this
    02:25
    weekly newspaper was published until
    02:27
    1865 with the passage of the 13th
    02:29
    amendment which outlawed slavery and
    02:32
    this newspaper called for the immediate
    02:34
    and uncompensated and to slavery what
    02:37
    that means is he wanted slavery to end
    02:38
    now and slave owners should not be paid
    02:40
    to give up their slaves he was against
    02:43
    colonization and he criticized the
    02:45
    Constitution because it was complicit
    02:47
    with slavery with big due to things like
    02:49
    the three-fifths compromise Frederick
    02:52
    Douglass was a former slave from
    02:54
    Maryland he was an incredible orator
    02:56
    supporter of women's rights and a
    02:58
    staunch abolitionists he was the creator
    03:00
    of the North Star and he had a very
    03:03
    famous speech which you should be
    03:04
    familiar with if you're using the
    03:05
    fill-in-the-blanks guide for this video
    03:08
    I have an excerpt from it
    03:09
    this speech was known as a fourth of
    03:12
    July speech and it starts off by saying
    03:14
    what to the American slave is your 4th
    03:16
    of July it is a very powerful great eggs
    03:19
    are something that could be seen on the
    03:21
    exam as well
    03:23
    Lydia Maria Child published an appeal in
    03:25
    favor of that class of Americans called
    03:28
    Africans from 1833 she advocated a media
    03:31
    and a slavery without compensation just
    03:33
    like William Lloyd Garrison and she
    03:35
    believed that women's rights and
    03:37
    abolitionism were intertwined this is
    03:39
    very important to know that many women
    03:41
    who are abolitionists were also women's
    03:43
    rights advocates Theodore weld was a
    03:46
    minister that preached throughout the
    03:48
    North the evils of slavery and he argued
    03:51
    that slavery was a sin and he was
    03:53
    instrumental in reshaping the movement
    03:55
    away from gradual emancipation to begin
    03:58
    discussing immediate emancipation this
    04:00
    gradual emancipation was a very big idea
    04:03
    in the 1800s and he really helped shift
    04:06
    that discussion more towards immediate
    04:08
    emancipation Henry Highland garnet
    04:11
    escaped from slavery in his youth and he
    04:14
    advocated slaves to rebel to achieve
    04:16
    freedom he was a member of the American
    04:19
    anti-slavery society and the founder of
    04:21
    the American and foreign anti-slavery
    04:23
    society which came later after the
    04:26
    can anti-slave society the American
    04:29
    anti-slavery society from 1833 to 1870
    04:32
    saw 250,000 members nationwide and
    04:35
    several african-americans served on the
    04:37
    board of directors including Theodore s
    04:40
    Wright a co-founder he attended
    04:42
    Princeton Theological Seminary and he
    04:45
    was a conductor on the Underground
    04:46
    Railroad so he helped slaves escape from
    04:50
    the south and he used religious
    04:52
    arguments against slavery also okay John
    04:56
    Brown know him from the Pottawatomie
    04:58
    Creek massacre in 1856 in Kansas but
    05:02
    he's most known for is his raid at
    05:04
    Harpers Ferry in 1859 he hope to inspire
    05:07
    a massive slave rebellion it did not
    05:09
    occur and he and his followers were
    05:12
    killed or put to death as a result of
    05:14
    this they were caught in this increased
    05:16
    tensions between the north and the south
    05:17
    this is a cause of the Civil War so the
    05:21
    South was afraid that many more people
    05:23
    in the North were like John Brown and
    05:24
    would inspire slave rebellions notice
    05:26
    that this is 1859 and the Civil War
    05:29
    starts in 1861 okay the Underground
    05:33
    Railroad was an organization that helped
    05:35
    slaves escape conductors were people who
    05:37
    helped lead slaves to safe houses
    05:39
    Harriet Tubman helped over 70 slaves
    05:42
    escaped including her parents and
    05:44
    herself she was a former slave and
    05:46
    although the number of slaves that
    05:48
    escaped was small it was a very powerful
    05:50
    symbol the Underground Railroad that was
    05:52
    loathe by the south so it gave a lot of
    05:56
    hope to many slaves okay definitely know
    05:59
    this slide here the abolitionist methods
    06:00
    there are three different ones that the
    06:02
    AP curriculum states so you should be
    06:04
    familiar with one of them is moral
    06:06
    arguments against slavery that's people
    06:08
    like Douglass garrison and weld some use
    06:11
    violence such as net turner and John
    06:14
    Brown and others helped in the assisting
    06:17
    of slave assisting slaves escapes and
    06:20
    that includes the Underground Railroad
    06:21
    and Harriet Tubman this to me is
    06:23
    screaming a short answer about different
    06:26
    methods used by abolitionists to help
    06:29
    and slavery all right for tests it's
    06:32
    multiple choices short answer identify
    06:33
    and describe different tactics use
    06:35
    that's what we just went over documents
    06:37
    Douglass is 4th of July speech is a
    06:40
    and for essays this could be part of
    06:42
    sectional tensions prior to the Civil
    06:44
    War all right guys thank you very much

    Dakota you're the first that I know from
    00:22
    North Dakota watching my videos missus
    00:24
    Terry's class at lchc mr. Baker's class
    00:27
    and MS clays class from Texas thank you
    00:30
    all so much for the support alright
    00:32
    let's take a look at key concept 5.1 it
    00:34
    states the United States became more
    00:36
    connected with the world pursued an
    00:38
    expansionist foreign policy in the
    00:40
    Western Hemisphere and he merged as a
    00:41
    destination for many migrants from other
    00:44
    countries that's from page 53 if you
    00:46
    want to link check the description for a
    00:49
    link to the curriculum framework it's a
    00:52
    big idea questions you should be able to
    00:53
    answer by the end of this video what
    00:55
    were the social economic and political
    00:56
    impacts of manifest destiny and westward
    00:59
    expansion and what were reasons for and
    01:02
    goals of the nativist movement that
    01:04
    emerged during this time alright let's
    01:07
    take a look at Roman numeral one it
    01:09
    states popular enthusiasm for US
    01:11
    expansion bolstered by economic and
    01:13
    security interest resulted in the
    01:15
    acquisition of new territories
    01:17
    substantial migration westward and new
    01:19
    overseas initiatives so not only is the
    01:22
    u.s. expanding within the present-day
    01:23
    continental united states they also are
    01:25
    expanding beyond its borders
    01:28
    now what were reasons for westward
    01:30
    migration while you want while their
    01:32
    arguments for access to natural and
    01:34
    mineral resources specially gold out
    01:36
    west the California Gold Rush in the
    01:39
    1840s we see Comstock Lode was a mined
    01:42
    for silver and settled settlements were
    01:44
    built around resources so you literally
    01:46
    literally see towns popping up around
    01:48
    these resources
    01:49
    you also have economic opportunities
    01:51
    this idea the safety valve theory which
    01:53
    will emerge a little bit later but this
    01:55
    is the idea that one could always pack
    01:57
    up and move out west and make money so
    01:59
    even if you are a poor factory worker in
    02:01
    New York City for example there's always
    02:04
    a safety valve of moving out west as a
    02:07
    farmer in making a decent living and a
    02:10
    third reason for westward migration was
    02:12
    religious refuge we have groups like the
    02:14
    Mormons who were led by this dude bring
    02:16
    him young to move west to Utah because
    02:19
    they were being persecuted for their
    02:20
    beliefs in other areas reasons for
    02:23
    manifest destiny now before we start
    02:25
    talking about manifest destiny be
    02:26
    familiar with this visual super super
    02:29
    super important you definitely need to
    02:31
    know and be able to break it down notice
    02:33
    how it's very clear and bright over here
    02:35
    and it's dark where America is going but
    02:38
    it looks like Columbia here will be
    02:40
    bringing the light with her also notice
    02:43
    the different modes of transportation
    02:44
    you have wagons you have railroads you
    02:47
    have Columbia stringing telegraph lines
    02:49
    and you have farmers moving out west
    02:52
    this dude's got a pickaxe in his hand so
    02:54
    he's probably gonna look for gold or
    02:55
    some sort of minerals and Native
    02:58
    Americans are being forced further and
    03:01
    further west as well so what were some
    03:04
    reasons for a manifest destiny
    03:05
    it was the spread of US institution
    03:07
    institutions and believes a lot of
    03:10
    people felt that the US should expand
    03:12
    democracy and its government across the
    03:15
    borders there are also economic motives
    03:17
    for access to land a lot of farmers
    03:19
    again wanted to be able to gain more
    03:21
    land out west and there are different
    03:24
    ways of the u.s. acquired land one
    03:26
    through the mexican-american war
    03:27
    the u.s. defeated Mexico and gained
    03:29
    what's known as the Mexican Cession this
    03:32
    area over here California and these
    03:34
    areas in blue so essentially the u.s.
    03:36
    gained one third of its size from the
    03:39
    Mexican Cession there's also
    03:41
    negotiations things like the GATS then
    03:43
    purchase in which the u.s. gained this
    03:45
    little area of land in yellow and they
    03:47
    hope to build a Transcontinental
    03:48
    Railroad now please take a moment if you
    03:51
    have not already you can even pause this
    03:53
    video YouTube Jimmy Fallon gets them
    03:56
    purchase and it will be some of the
    03:58
    funniest four minutes of your life I
    04:00
    promise
    04:01
    also though I got territory up here the
    04:04
    u.s. settled with Britain along the u.s.
    04:07
    Canadian border and they established the
    04:09
    boundary at the 49th parallel now this
    04:12
    land acquisition did lead to debates
    04:14
    over things like slavery David well Mont
    04:17
    was a congressman from Pennsylvania and
    04:21
    he introduced the Wilmot Proviso and he
    04:23
    sought to ban slavery in the Mexican
    04:26
    and this is kind of the idea of the free
    04:28
    soil party which sought the non
    04:29
    extension of slavery so the the number
    04:32
    one debate will be over slavery well
    04:33
    this newly acquired land be free or
    04:35
    slave the status of Native Americans and
    04:38
    Mexicans was a debate how would they be
    04:40
    incorporated Mexicans after the
    04:42
    mexican-american war were given a choice
    04:44
    to become US citizens or moved to other
    04:46
    parts of Mexico and something like 90
    04:48
    percent of them chose to become US
    04:50
    citizens but there was debate over the
    04:52
    treatment of them US government
    04:55
    encouraged westward expansion in a
    04:57
    number of ways the Homestead Act was
    04:58
    passed in 1862 and established at homes
    05:01
    and established homesteads like the one
    05:03
    in the picture here this would provide
    05:05
    160 acres of land with a promise to live
    05:08
    on and improve the land for five years
    05:10
    and the government also provided
    05:12
    subsidies or gave money and land to
    05:14
    railroads to expand out west during this
    05:18
    time the u.s. also sought initiatives
    05:19
    with Asia you have Matthew Perry and the
    05:21
    opening of Japan in the 1850s he goes
    05:23
    over he's like he's like hey what's up
    05:25
    Ross I want to go to Japan no friends
    05:27
    joke for you and the u.s. begins trading
    05:30
    with Japan and clipper ships emerge and
    05:33
    these allow for trade faster trade with
    05:36
    other countries in particular China
    05:38
    which the u.s. sought to trade tea with
    05:40
    and missionaries were established in
    05:42
    China to spread a Christianity also so
    05:45
    let's take a look at Roman numeral two
    05:47
    it states in the 1840s 1850s Americans
    05:50
    continue to bake questions about rights
    05:52
    and citizenship for various groups of US
    05:54
    inhabitants we have immigration from
    05:56
    Europe and Asia when we're talking about
    05:58
    European immigrants there's Chu in
    06:00
    particular we're going to talk about the
    06:02
    Irish they tend to settle in cities in
    06:04
    the north northeast and they were mostly
    06:06
    catholic and they came over because of
    06:08
    the Irish potato famine going on during
    06:11
    the 1840s what's known as the dark 40s
    06:13
    Germans are the other European group
    06:15
    during this time that they tended to
    06:17
    settle in the frontier as farmers and
    06:19
    the Midwest and places like Ohio
    06:21
    particularly Cincinnati and then even
    06:23
    st. Louis as well and many immigrant
    06:27
    children attended parochial schools or
    06:29
    private schools and this would really
    06:30
    upset many Americans Asian immigrants
    06:33
    during this time tend to settle on the
    06:35
    west coast and the Chinese came over in
    06:38
    large numbers in the 1850s they
    06:39
    when working gold mines factories and
    06:41
    they also do farming as well and later
    06:44
    we'll talk about in period sex the
    06:46
    Chinese Exclusion Act in 1880 to forbid
    06:48
    Chinese immigration and both immigrants
    06:52
    both groups of immigrants Europeans and
    06:54
    Asian's they tended to settle in ethnic
    06:57
    communities and they would preserve
    06:58
    their own cultures if you've ever been
    07:00
    to in New York or San Francisco or
    07:02
    Washington they have Chinatown that is a
    07:05
    section of that city that is a specific
    07:08
    ethnic community with emergence of
    07:12
    nativism which is the fear hatred
    07:14
    distrust of foreigners and here's a very
    07:17
    well known political cartoon you should
    07:18
    be familiar that we have Irish here and
    07:20
    Germans over here and notice they're
    07:22
    stealing the ballot box they tended to
    07:24
    vote Democratic major argument for the
    07:27
    nativist used against groups like the
    07:29
    Irish in particular where that the Irish
    07:31
    were Catholics this nativism movements
    07:33
    heavily anti-catholic and they sought to
    07:36
    limit immigrants political power I can't
    07:38
    stress enough how important that is they
    07:39
    wanted to limit immigrants political
    07:42
    power the know-nothing party emerged
    07:45
    during this time this was an
    07:46
    anti-immigrant anti-catholic party and
    07:48
    they sought to limit the power and
    07:50
    influence of immigrants I can't state
    07:52
    that enough please make sure you know
    07:54
    that during this time we also have
    07:56
    conflicts with Mexican Americans and
    07:57
    natives in 1864 while the civil war is
    08:00
    going on we had the Sand Creek Massacre
    08:01
    in which a Colorado militia attacked
    08:04
    Cheyenne Indians they killed over 100
    08:06
    Indians mostly women and children with
    08:09
    the Battle of Little Bighorn was which
    08:11
    is also known as Custer's last stand
    08:12
    this is where natives attacked and
    08:14
    killed Custer and his men and the u.s.
    08:17
    sought to assimilate many natives with
    08:20
    expectation they would adopt white ways
    08:22
    and this will be a continuing theme into
    08:24
    period six where we'll spend a lot more
    08:26
    time on it all right some test tips for
    08:29
    you four or five point one for multiple
    08:31
    choice and short answer be able to
    08:32
    identify and explain reasons from AFS
    08:35
    destiny the impacts of the
    08:36
    mexican-american war on slavery hint the
    08:39
    debate will be over whether the land
    08:41
    should be free or slave what were ways
    08:42
    to us encourage westward expansion what
    08:45
    was nativism what were causes for it and
    08:47
    examples of it and for essays how did
    08:50
    westward expansion lead to tensions
    08:53
    over slavery I can't stress enough how
    08:55
    often that has been asked in some
    08:57
    variation in the past and companion
    08:59
    experiences of immigrants with other
    09:00
    with another time period and when we get
    09:03
    into time period six you'll be able to
    09:05
    answer that a lot more all right guys
    09:08
    look forward to seeing right back here

    00:33
    alright let's take a look at key concept
    00:35
    5.2 it's States intensified by expansion
    00:39
    in deepening regional divisions debates
    00:41
    over slavery and other economic cultural
    00:44
    and political issues let the nation into
    00:46
    Civil War I have lots of videos in the
    00:49
    description so if there's anything in
    00:51
    here you want more detail on check it
    00:53
    out lots of stuff in this video now some
    00:57
    big idea questions you should be able to
    00:59
    answer why did various government
    01:01
    actions regarding the issue of slavery
    01:03
    fail and why did the election of 1860
    01:06
    lead to secession by South Carolina and
    01:10
    other states that is a very important
    01:13
    event in US history
    01:15
    alright Roman number one states
    01:16
    ideological and economic differences
    01:18
    over slavery produced an array of
    01:20
    diverging responses from African
    01:23
    American Americans in the north and the
    01:25
    south so really in the antebellum period
    01:28
    in Antebellum means pre Civil War there
    01:30
    are two emerging economies that are very
    01:32
    disparate in America and in the north we
    01:36
    have manufacturing the relied on free
    01:37
    labor and the south we have agriculture
    01:40
    that is reliant heavily on slaver
    01:42
    especially for cotton the South's
    01:46
    nickname during this time is King cotton
    01:48
    because the economy is so dependent upon
    01:50
    it we have a free soil movement and this
    01:53
    emerges and the Free Soil movement it
    01:56
    sought to keep slavery from expanding
    01:58
    and the Free Soil party slogan was free
    02:03
    labor free soil free men and it was
    02:05
    coined by this dude salmon P chase who
    02:08
    goes on to be Lincoln's Treasury
    02:10
    secretary and the 6th Supreme Court
    02:13
    chief
    02:13
    justise he was also from Cincinnati Ohio
    02:16
    and the free saw moment really movement
    02:20
    really focused their efforts into the
    02:22
    land that is gained from the Mexican
    02:24
    Cession so that land out west and they
    02:27
    believe that slavery was incompatible
    02:29
    with free labor mostly because it took
    02:31
    away jobs and economic opportunities
    02:33
    from whites let's talk about an
    02:36
    abolitionist movement it was made up of
    02:37
    whites and blacks and although we tend
    02:40
    to think that in the North was against
    02:41
    slavery most people in the north would
    02:43
    not consider themselves abolitionists it
    02:45
    really made up a small percentage of the
    02:47
    people in the north their various
    02:49
    tactics that they used they would use
    02:52
    things like moral arguments this idea
    02:53
    that that slavery is incompatible with
    02:55
    natural rights and all men are created
    02:57
    equal and the Enlightenment ideas that
    02:59
    were used decades before they would help
    03:01
    assist slaves in their escapes most
    03:03
    notably the Underground Railroad
    03:05
    you have Harriet Tubman the very famous
    03:07
    conductor on the Underground Railroad
    03:09
    that helped that made dozens of trips
    03:11
    back to the south to help slaves escape
    03:14
    and here's a map of the Underground
    03:15
    Railroad you'll notice the end result
    03:18
    here is going to be Canada so a lot of
    03:20
    the cities where kind of ends are right
    03:22
    on the border with Canada here where I
    03:23
    live in Buffalo Niagara Falls is right
    03:26
    over here and let's played a huge role
    03:27
    now to ground red world because Canada
    03:29
    was right there there's also a
    03:32
    willingness to use violence you see this
    03:34
    at John Brown's raid at Harpers Ferry
    03:36
    which he took over a federal Arsenal and
    03:38
    hoping to eliminate slavery in the South
    03:41
    responded with various arguments that
    03:42
    would be used to defend slavery they
    03:45
    would use racial doctrines and this
    03:46
    argued that African Americans like
    03:48
    Native Americans before them were seen
    03:50
    as savages that they were less of humans
    03:52
    John T Calhoun and others argued that
    03:55
    slavery was a positive good that slaves
    03:57
    actually had it better off than northern
    03:59
    factory workers and they also pointed to
    04:02
    the Constitution and they believe that
    04:03
    states rights that slavery was protected
    04:06
    by states rights in the Supreme Court in
    04:09
    the in the court case Dred Scott vs.
    04:12
    Sanford which we'll talk about just a
    04:13
    moment stated that property couldn't be
    04:15
    taken away without due process in slaves
    04:18
    were therefore deemed property so the
    04:20
    South argued that slavery was upheld and
    04:23
    protected by the Constitution and
    04:25
    through states rights
    04:27
    okay Roman numeral two states and
    04:29
    debates over slavery came to dominate
    04:30
    political discussions in the 1850s and
    04:33
    this culminated in the bitter election
    04:36
    of 1860 and the secession of southern
    04:39
    states so we had the Mexican Cession
    04:41
    when the u.s. won the mexican-american
    04:43
    war they gained all this land out in the
    04:46
    present-day southwest portion of the
    04:48
    United States and this led to debates
    04:49
    over slavery nowhere do we see this more
    04:52
    so then the Wilmot Proviso this was an
    04:55
    amendment to a bill during the
    04:57
    mexican-american war introduced by David
    04:59
    Wilmot and he sought to ban slavery in
    05:01
    the Mexican Cession this is the idea of
    05:04
    the Free Soil party the idea of keeping
    05:05
    slavery from spreading now of note it's
    05:09
    important to note that the Wilmot
    05:10
    Proviso will pass the House but it does
    05:12
    not pass the Senate and the reason it
    05:14
    passes the House is there are more
    05:16
    people living in the north where the
    05:17
    North has an advantage in the house but
    05:19
    they do not have an advantage in the
    05:21
    Senate because at this time the number
    05:23
    of states were equal so the Wilmot
    05:26
    Proviso sought to keep slavery from
    05:28
    spreading in the south did everything in
    05:30
    its power to keep that from passing
    05:32
    definitely know that this to me is
    05:34
    screaming a stimulus for a multiple
    05:37
    choice question or even a short answer
    05:38
    question if you're writing an essay
    05:40
    about slavery this is something you want
    05:42
    to include as well okay so let's talk
    05:45
    about attempts to resolve slavery issue
    05:46
    in the territories through the courts we
    05:48
    the Dred Scott vs. Sanford case and here
    05:50
    is Dred Scott he was a slave who sued
    05:53
    for his freedom because he had been
    05:54
    taken to a free territory and the
    05:56
    Supreme Court ruled that African
    05:58
    Americans both free and slave were
    06:00
    deemed not to be citizens of the United
    06:02
    States and they could not sue this is a
    06:04
    very similar outcome to the Cherokee
    06:06
    Nation versus Georgia Supreme Court case
    06:08
    in which John Marshall stated that
    06:10
    Native Americans were not citizens and
    06:12
    could not sue furthermore the Supreme
    06:15
    Court under Roger B Taney declared that
    06:17
    slaves were considered property and they
    06:19
    could not be taken away I mention that
    06:20
    earlier the Fifth Amendment states that
    06:22
    individuals cannot be deprived of life
    06:25
    liberty or property without due process
    06:26
    and finally the Supreme Court also said
    06:29
    that Congress could not regulate slavery
    06:31
    in the territories so that Missouri
    06:33
    Compromise which was already overturned
    06:35
    by the kansas-nebraska Act is now
    06:37
    officially dead and this is in 1857 and
    06:40
    this
    06:41
    really infuriates the north they begin
    06:44
    to view it as more of an opinion not
    06:46
    necessarily something set in stone this
    06:48
    really creates a lot of tensions between
    06:49
    the north and the south
    06:51
    this will also split the Democratic
    06:53
    Party along sectional lines you'll see
    06:55
    people like Stephen Douglas in the north
    06:57
    get a lot of support but he will not get
    06:59
    support from Democrats in the south
    07:01
    continue with attempts we have national
    07:04
    leaders people like Henry Clay and
    07:05
    Stephen Douglas with the compromise of
    07:07
    1850 major parts that you should know
    07:10
    California was added as a free state and
    07:12
    this will tip the balance in favor of
    07:14
    the free states the slave trade was
    07:16
    abolished in Washington DC not slavery
    07:18
    but the slave trade and the reason why
    07:20
    was there were a lot of foreign
    07:22
    dignitaries who would come to Washington
    07:23
    DC and would be horrified at the slave
    07:25
    trade we have popular sovereignty in the
    07:28
    Mexican Cession which allowed people
    07:29
    living there to vote whether or not the
    07:32
    territory should be free or slave and we
    07:34
    also have the passage of a more strict
    07:36
    Fugitive Slave Law this is the most
    07:38
    controversial part of the compromise of
    07:40
    1850 this states that northerners had to
    07:42
    actively become involved in the
    07:44
    retrieval of runaway slaves many North
    07:47
    northerners day like this and they pass
    07:48
    personal liberty laws which forbid the
    07:51
    use of courtrooms and jails for the
    07:54
    retrieval of runaway slaves that's
    07:55
    essentially nullifying a federal law in
    07:58
    the south would be very upset with it
    08:00
    the kids Sabratha act a few years later
    08:02
    was created by Stephen Douglas this
    08:04
    allowed for popular sovereignty in
    08:06
    Kansas and Nebraska and the expectation
    08:10
    was this unwritten rule as a kids would
    08:11
    be slave in Nebraska would be free now
    08:14
    it's important to note that both of
    08:15
    these are located in the Louisiana
    08:17
    Purchase territory and both of them are
    08:19
    above that 3630 line so this essentially
    08:22
    reverses the Missouri Compromise in this
    08:25
    help lead to the creation of the
    08:26
    Republican Party because so many people
    08:29
    were upset with this act and they wanted
    08:32
    to keep slavery from spreading that's
    08:33
    going to be the platform of the
    08:35
    Republican Party to keep slavery from
    08:37
    spreading so with the end of the second
    08:39
    party system the Whig party ceases to
    08:41
    exist and this occurs due to issues over
    08:43
    slavery and anti-immigration sentiment
    08:46
    again keep in mind that know-nothing
    08:47
    party that we talked about in the last
    08:49
    key concept video this will lead to the
    08:51
    emergence of sectional parties and we'll
    08:53
    see this in the election
    08:54
    60 in just a moment and the Republican
    08:56
    Party will emerge and it will become
    08:58
    very popular in the north and the Mid
    09:00
    West
    09:01
    this is made up of Free Soilers again
    09:03
    people want to keep slavery from
    09:04
    expanding and former Whigs it is so
    09:08
    important to note that in 1860 Lincoln's
    09:10
    platform was the non extension of
    09:12
    slavery he did not want to ban slavery
    09:13
    he want to keep it from extending so in
    09:17
    1860 Lincoln will win on a free soil
    09:19
    platform without a single southern
    09:22
    electoral vote from the south so if you
    09:25
    take a look here this picture will go in
    09:26
    just a second all the green states here
    09:29
    in the south they are going to be the
    09:31
    ones that eventually end up succeeding -
    09:33
    Maryland and Delaware over here but they
    09:35
    did not vote for Lincoln he doesn't win
    09:37
    a single liked or vote in the south and
    09:38
    the south would say wait a minute
    09:40
    Lincoln wins and none of us voted for
    09:43
    him therefore we have no control over
    09:44
    who the president is so they leave if
    09:47
    you notice here every state that voted
    09:49
    against Lincoln is a slave owning state
    09:53
    was a slave owning state he did not I
    09:56
    can't repeat this enough want to end
    09:58
    slavery but keep it from spreading we'll
    09:59
    see that change in the next key concept
    10:02
    video but for now he does not want to
    10:04
    end slavery this is the immediate cause
    10:06
    of the civil war if you see a question
    10:08
    about what was the immediate cause of
    10:09
    the Civil War it's going to be the
    10:11
    election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and
    10:15
    South Carolina will secede on December
    10:17
    20th 1860 and shortly after many other
    10:20
    states will follow suit alright let's go
    10:22
    over some test tips for multiple choices
    10:23
    short answer no the reasons for the
    10:26
    decline of the second party system
    10:27
    characteristics of the abolitionist
    10:29
    movement different tactics that they
    10:31
    used the compromise of 1850
    10:33
    kansas-nebraska act in the Dred Scott
    10:34
    decision
    10:35
    all of them are fair game and I've
    10:37
    detailed videos on all of them in the
    10:38
    description and for essay topics ways
    10:41
    that the government sought to settle the
    10:43
    issue of slavery and that's going to
    10:45
    come right back to these things right
    10:47
    here all right guys look forward to
    10:49
    seeing you back here four key concept
    10:50
    five point three where we'll take a look
    10:52
    at the reading of this very famous
    10:54

    10:57
    Proclamation
    10:58
    oh there's salmon P chase from

    for the revised 2015 editions the most
    00:05
    up-to-date video you will find a key
    00:08
    concept 5.3 alright you know how it goes
    00:11
    at shout out time shoutouts to miss
    00:13
    Harriet Gray's class in Brooklyn miss

    luck thank you guys for watching I do
    00:29
    appreciate you do great on the exam okay
    00:31
    let's take a look at key concept 5.3 ded
    00:33
    States the Union victory in the Civil
    00:36
    War and the contested reconstruction of
    00:39
    the South settled the issues of slavery
    00:41
    and secession but left many questions
    00:44
    about the power of the federal
    00:46
    government and citizenship rights
    00:49
    that's from page 57 make sure you're
    00:52
    taking a peep at it so some big idea
    00:54
    questions why did the North prevail in
    00:56
    the Civil War and what impacts did the
    00:58
    13th 14th and 15th amendments have on
    01:01
    women in african-americans there is no
    01:04
    getting around it you need to know these
    01:06
    amendments they're specifically mention
    01:08
    know them inside and out
    01:10
    and finally what were whites the South
    01:12
    resisted the above amendment so know
    01:16
    that too but don't worry I got you
    01:18
    covered
    01:18
    all right Roman numeral one states the
    01:21
    North's greater manpower and industrial
    01:23
    resources the leadership of Abraham
    01:25
    Lincoln and others and the decision to
    01:27
    emancipate slaves eventually led to the
    01:29
    Union military victory over the
    01:31
    Confederacy in the devastating Civil War
    01:35
    now a big idea that you should know both
    01:36
    the north and the south
    01:38
    they dedicated their economies and
    01:40
    societies to fighting the war they both
    01:43
    were engaged in essentially a total war
    01:45
    where they're dedicating all resources
    01:47
    to it both of them instituted
    01:50
    conscription which is a fancy word for
    01:52
    saying draft you're writing an essay you
    01:55
    want to impress the readers make sure
    01:56
    you say conscription instead of draft
    01:59
    there was also opposition in both
    02:01
    regions for example in the north
    02:03
    Maryland newspapers were shut down by
    02:05
    Abe Lincoln that were critical of him in
    02:07
    the war effort in New York City you have
    02:09
    draft rights that emerge mostly with
    02:11
    Irish immigrants this gave the were the
    02:13
    rich man's war but a poor man's fight
    02:15
    because individuals could hire a
    02:18
    substitute for $300 so you see rich
    02:21
    people were able to get out of fighting
    02:23
    and a famous individual who hired her
    02:25
    substitute was Teddy Roosevelt's father
    02:27
    and in the south we see many farmers
    02:31
    refuse to fight because they didn't want
    02:32
    to leave their plantations and they
    02:34
    would not let slaves fight for the
    02:36
    southern cause either so opposition
    02:39
    persisted in both regions now very
    02:42
    important to know Lincoln's war goals
    02:44
    throughout the Civil War in the
    02:47
    beginning he stated the war was fought
    02:49
    to preserve the Union it had nothing to
    02:51
    do with slavery and then in September
    02:54
    22nd of 1862 he issued the Emancipation
    02:58
    Proclamation which would take effect on
    03:00
    January 1st 1863 and this helped change
    03:03
    the purpose of the war and here he is
    03:06
    with his cabinet there is Secretary of
    03:09
    State William Seward and Secretary of
    03:11
    Treasury and future 6th Chief Justice of
    03:14
    the Supreme Court salmon P chase look at
    03:16
    that dude he's from Cincinnati then a D
    03:20
    now what the Emancipation Proclamation
    03:22
    does is it frees all slaves in areas of
    03:25
    rebellion where Lincoln really had no
    03:27
    power but this will keep European powers
    03:30
    from fight siding with the South
    03:32
    especially Great Britain because they
    03:34
    had already banned slavery and the
    03:36
    British public would not allow their
    03:38
    country to side with the south which
    03:40
    promoted slavery also this led to many
    03:43
    african-americans enlisting in the Union
    03:46
    Army
    03:46
    now while the War raged on Lincoln
    03:48
    sought to reunify the country he had
    03:50
    plans for reunify in the country even in
    03:53
    the middle of the war that same year
    03:55
    1863 we have the Gettysburg Address and
    03:58
    here is Abe Lincoln right there you can
    03:59
    see the bottom of his beard still no
    04:01
    mustache there he will reference a new
    04:03
    birth of freedom that is referencing
    04:06
    slaves this idea that the war should be
    04:07
    fought about should be fought for
    04:09
    something more so ensuring freedom for a
    04:12
    group of people he referenced the
    04:14
    Declaration of Independence the idea
    04:15
    that all men are created equal and he
    04:18
    wanted to see that this really was true
    04:20
    in the 1860s early on the Confederacy
    04:24
    was very successful but the Union
    04:27
    ultimately prevail now pay attention
    04:29
    here this is screaming to me a short
    04:31
    answer question briefly explain reasons
    04:34
    why the Union won the Civil War make
    04:37
    sure you know this so we have overtime
    04:39
    improvements in leadership and strategy
    04:41
    people like William Tecumseh Sherman and
    04:44
    general ulysses s grant with the
    04:47
    Anaconda plan which was a blockade of
    04:49
    the south and was meant to kind of
    04:51
    strangle the southern economy we also
    04:54
    have key victories Antietam even though
    04:56
    it was a tie this really was a strategic
    04:58
    victory for the north it was a morale
    05:00
    boost and this led to the Emancipation
    05:02
    Proclamation which helped keep Europe
    05:04
    out of the war as we just talked about
    05:06
    also Gettysburg we had the Gettysburg
    05:08
    Address in which Lincoln begins to call
    05:10
    for the war having a bigger purpose than
    05:12
    just preserving the Union the north also
    05:15
    had greater resources they had a larger
    05:17
    population and significantly more
    05:19
    factories something like 90 percent the
    05:21
    factories were located on the Union side
    05:23
    and the South was devastated here's a
    05:27
    picture of the South's infrastructure
    05:28
    you notice it is just completely
    05:30
    destroyed and part of that was due to
    05:32
    Sherman's march to the sea in which they
    05:35
    went down through Georgia and pretty
    05:37
    much just destroyed southern
    05:38
    infrastructure so these are reasons why
    05:41
    the north want make sure you know them
    05:43
    and can explain them Roman numeral two
    05:45
    states reconstruction in the Civil War
    05:47
    ended slavery altered the relationships
    05:49
    between the states and the federal
    05:51
    government and led to debates over new
    05:53
    definitions of citizenship particularly
    05:55
    regarding the rights of African
    05:56
    Americans women and other minorities so
    05:59
    we have the Reconstruction Amendments
    06:00
    you must know these bad boys know we're
    06:02
    fans or buts about it
    06:03
    13th is gonna Bala slavery here's an
    06:05
    illustration from it passing in that in
    06:08
    the House of Representatives 14th
    06:10
    amendment states if you are born in the
    06:12
    United States you are a citizen it also
    06:14
    grants equal protection under the law
    06:16
    that is a part you will come back to a
    06:18
    lot an AP government equal protection
    06:21
    under the law and the 15th provides
    06:23
    universal adult male suffrage so no
    06:26
    longer can voting be denied to African
    06:29
    American males now what are the impacts
    06:32
    of the 14th and 15th amendments on the
    06:34
    women's rights movement very important
    06:37
    to know people like Frederick Douglas
    06:39
    this former slave and great orator
    06:41
    favored black suffrage prior to women's
    06:44
    suffrage he argued that African
    06:46
    Americans suffered long enough and they
    06:47
    deserve the right to vote first now on
    06:49
    the other side you have Elizabeth Cady
    06:51
    Stanton susan b anthony they were afraid
    06:54
    that women's suffrage would not be
    06:55
    granted anytime soon so this really
    06:57
    splits the women's rights movement some
    07:00
    favorite african-american male suffrage
    07:02
    first other did others did not because
    07:04
    they wanted women included as well now
    07:07
    the Republicans the Congress they're
    07:08
    really going to play a large role in
    07:10
    reconstruction they helped change the
    07:12
    balance of power between the presidency
    07:14
    and Congress and this is seen in
    07:16
    presidential versus radical
    07:18
    reconstruction we have dudes like
    07:19
    Thaddeus Stevens the Republican
    07:22
    congressman versus Andrew Johnson
    07:25
    Lincoln's vice president it's ultimately
    07:27
    Congress that's going to determine when
    07:29
    to remit states will also see this
    07:32
    balance shifting between the two and
    07:33
    Johnson pretty much vetoing everything
    07:36
    from Congress and then Congress pretty
    07:37
    much overriding every single one of his
    07:40
    vetoes and Andrew Johnson is ultimately
    07:42
    impeached for violating the tenure of
    07:44
    office act he will not be removed make
    07:47
    sure you know impeachment does not mean
    07:49
    you are removed from office you can be
    07:52
    removed
    07:52
    it simply means charges are brought
    07:54
    against you and this will lead to an
    07:56
    increase of political opportunities for
    07:59
    blacks as a result of Republican
    08:00
    Congress you have people like Robert
    08:03
    smalls who was a steamer pilot during
    08:05
    the Civil War and helped bring a ship to
    08:07
    the Union Navy and he later became a
    08:09
    congressman and here armed rebels here
    08:12
    he is he was a senator from Mississippi
    08:15
    which was Jefferson Davis estate the
    08:18
    president of the Confederacy he was the
    08:20
    first african-american to serve in the
    08:22
    Senate so for a time african-american
    08:25
    men gained lots of power continuing with
    08:28
    this wider Reconstruction ultimately
    08:30
    failed well we have determined southern
    08:31
    resistance by the way this could also be
    08:33
    another short answer question or you
    08:35
    could tied it to an essay the successes
    08:38
    and failures of reconstruction we have
    08:40
    the emergence of Redeemer governments
    08:41
    these were southern local and state
    08:43
    governments that were Democrat there
    08:46
    were Democrats and they ousted
    08:47
    Republican governments and they began to
    08:49
    redeem or take back their governments
    08:51
    this was often done through violence and
    08:53
    intimidation groups like the
    08:55
    keh keh keh took a part in this the KKK
    08:58
    founded by Nathan Forrest terrorized
    09:01
    blacks and Republicans and anybody that
    09:03
    supported reconstruction we also see the
    09:05
    North's waning resolve now you notice
    09:08
    that this word waning is bolded
    09:09
    underlined and italicized this is
    09:11
    mentioned in the curriculum waning means
    09:13
    to decrease so ultimately reconstruction
    09:16
    will fail because the North's resolve or
    09:19
    dedication began to decrease don't get
    09:22
    tripped up because you don't know the
    09:23
    word waning make sure you know it so in
    09:26
    1874 we have Charles Sumner he passes
    09:28
    away one of the leading republican
    09:30
    congressmen so once he's gone there's
    09:32
    few people to carry on his vision and we
    09:36
    all saw the panic of 1873 this is a very
    09:39
    hard panic on the country this will
    09:41
    taint the Republican Party because
    09:43
    they're in control and many people began
    09:45
    to call for a smaller government so the
    09:47
    desire to rebuild the south wanes or
    09:51
    decreases in the 1870s make sure you
    09:53
    know that promise me you'll know I
    09:54
    promise me say I promise good thank you
    09:57
    okay land distribution the South
    10:00
    post-civil war plantation owners they
    10:01
    still owned a majority of the land
    10:04
    former slaves had a lot of difficulty
    10:06
    acquiring land there was high interest
    10:08
    rates this is known as the crop lien
    10:10
    system so if they wanted to buy land
    10:11
    they would have to take out a loan at a
    10:13
    very high interest rate many
    10:15
    african-americans and poor whites became
    10:17
    sharecroppers sharecroppers as mentioned
    10:19
    make sure you know this what's a
    10:20
    sharecropper well it's free people who
    10:23
    worked on farms and exchange labor for
    10:25
    using land and housing basically they
    10:28
    would rent some land from a landowner
    10:30
    and half of their crops were typically
    10:32
    given to the landowner in exchange for
    10:34
    the rent
    10:36
    now if cotton prices fell and they did
    10:38
    in the 1870s again with that panic of
    10:40
    1873 we have perpetual or pretty much
    10:43
    forever debt this was common for most
    10:45
    sharecroppers and by 1890 most other
    10:48
    blacks were sharecroppers and many
    10:50
    blacks in the South actually worked for
    10:53
    their former slave owners so the
    10:55
    economic opportunities for
    10:57
    african-americans were still severely
    10:59
    limited after the Civil War in the south
    11:01
    okay what were ways that the 14th and
    11:04
    15th amendments were restricted you must
    11:06
    know these please promise me you'll know
    11:07
    these we have said
    11:08
    Gatien or Jim Crow laws this was upheld
    11:11
    we'll get to this in period six the
    11:13
    court case Plessy vs. Ferguson which
    11:15
    established the principle of separate
    11:17
    but equal we have violence as well the
    11:19
    KKK and the white League these were
    11:20
    organizations that intimidated African
    11:23
    Americans from voting so this was a way
    11:24
    to limit the power of the Fifteenth
    11:26
    Amendment you see this very famous
    11:28
    political cartoon it says worse than
    11:30
    slavery and you have the white League
    11:32
    and the KKK over there terrorizing
    11:34
    African Americans Supreme Court
    11:36
    decisions things like the civil rights
    11:38
    cases which say that individuals and
    11:40
    private businesses could discriminate
    11:42
    against a group of people such as
    11:45
    African Americans the government could
    11:47
    not that will be overturned local
    11:49
    political tactics these are things like
    11:51
    poll taxes where you have to pay in
    11:53
    order to vote literacy tests which you
    11:55
    have to take a test and order to vote
    11:57
    and grandfather clauses which excluded
    11:59
    whites from the poll taxes and literacy
    12:01
    tests and although these amendments in
    12:05
    the short term did not really have a lot
    12:07
    of teeth they will be very very
    12:09
    important in the 20th century in the
    12:11
    1950s and 1960s with the civil rights
    12:13
    movement to uphold civil rights that is
    12:16
    specifically mentioned in the curriculum
    12:18
    make sure you know that long term these
    12:20
    amendments will be used to promote civil
    12:23
    rights in the 1950s and 1960s you're
    12:25
    writing an essay about reconstruction
    12:27
    boom there's your that's his point
    12:29
    connected to the 1950s and 1960s civil
    12:31
    rights movement you're welcome and an
    12:34
    example this is Brown versus the Board
    12:36
    of Education which overturned separate
    12:38
    but equal its test tip time for multiple
    12:41
    choices short answer reasons for the
    12:43
    union's victory in the Civil War what
    12:45
    were ways to southern governments
    12:46
    restricted the 13 through 15 amendments
    12:48
    and that was the last slide
    12:50
    no waning what is it yeah you know it
    12:53
    it's decreasing for essays
    12:55
    reconstruction as a turning point this
    12:57
    screams to me a turning point you know
    13:00
    what you're discussing before and after
    13:02
    was reconstruction a positive or
    13:04
    negative thing for African Americans or
    13:06
    was it both and connecting
    13:08
    Reconstruction Amendments to civil the
    13:10
    civil rights movement of the 1950s and
    13:12
    1960s all right guys look forward to
    13:14
    seeing you right back here four key
    13:15
    concepts 6.1 when we will see in my
    13:18
    opinion one of the sweetest mustaches in
    13:20
    US history look
    13:22
    get Terrence Powderly mustache game ed
    13:24

    00:00
    yo what's going on a push people we got
    00:02
    a new video for you today which I will
    00:03
    examine key documents from period 5 now
    00:06
    I will break down different political
    00:09
    cartoons and documents that you should
    00:11
    be familiar with from purified that
    00:13
    could potentially appear on any exam in
    00:15
    the form of a prompt for multiple choice
    00:18
    or short answer questions so I will go
    00:21
    through these and hopefully you will
    00:22
    have a better understanding of these
    00:23
    documents from period number 5 all right
    00:26
    let's start I'll talk about wave lloyd
    00:27
    garrison now even though he started in
    00:29
    1831 with his newspaper The Liberator
    00:32
    this dude was still around in 1860 so he
    00:34
    is a part of period 5 so who was he
    00:36
    while he was the publisher as I
    00:37
    mentioned of the Liberator and this was
    00:40
    an abolitionist newspaper now here is in
    00:43
    a diet here is a document that you could
    00:45
    encounter and it says I'm aware that
    00:48
    many object to the severity of my
    00:50
    language but is there not cause for
    00:52
    severity I will be as harsh as truth and
    00:55
    is uncompromising as justice on this
    00:58
    subject I do not wish to think or speak
    01:00
    or write with moderation
    01:02
    no no tell a man whose house is on fire
    01:05
    to give a moderate alarm but urge me not
    01:08
    to use moderation in a cause like the
    01:10
    present I am an earnest
    01:12
    I will not equivocate I will not excuse
    01:14
    I will not retreat a single inch and I
    01:17
    will be heard so what are some possible
    01:20
    multiple choice of short-answer tips for
    01:22
    this document well this is an example of
    01:24
    abolitionism in the north even though
    01:27
    this was a minority and specifically
    01:29
    mentions in the new curriculum how the
    01:31
    abolitionist movement was a minority
    01:32
    movement in the north and this is also
    01:35
    an example of using fierce arguments
    01:38
    against the institution of slavery
    01:40
    something else that could be asked this
    01:42
    who would agree with him and that would
    01:44
    be northern abolitionists who would most
    01:46
    likely not support Waverly Garrison's
    01:48
    message perhaps somebody like southern
    01:50
    plantation owners alright the next one
    01:53
    I'm sure you've seen this picture before
    01:54
    this deals with manifest destiny it was
    01:57
    created by John ghast it is titled
    01:59
    American Progress in 1872 so what do we
    02:02
    notice every time I look at this
    02:04
    painting I noticed something else you
    02:06
    see Columbia this image of America is
    02:09
    moving westward with telegraph lines so
    02:11
    that implies that the government is a
    02:13
    encouraging westward expansion you see
    02:15
    many Americans are moving westward
    02:17
    towards darkness notice that there is
    02:20
    light over in the top right hand side of
    02:24
    this painting and there is darkness on
    02:26
    the left-hand side in Colombia is moving
    02:28
    towards the darkness as assuming she
    02:32
    will bring the light with her
    02:33
    you also notice that Native Americans
    02:35
    I'm a lap dance side are being moved
    02:38
    further west that is a major implication
    02:40
    of westward expansion so are the
    02:42
    implications of this cartoon while
    02:44
    manifest destiny is seen as positive and
    02:46
    some possible multiple choice and short
    02:48
    answer tips you should be familiar with
    02:50
    the environmental transformation of
    02:52
    westward expansion what impacts did that
    02:55
    have you have the railroads being built
    02:58
    to the bison or Buffalo being decimated
    03:00
    you have the near extinction of the
    03:03
    Buffalo they were down to less than a
    03:04
    thousand at one point in US history what
    03:07
    is the impact on different groups of
    03:09
    people including Native Americans many
    03:10
    of them lost their land they were forced
    03:12
    onto reservations and forced signed 160
    03:14
    acres of land under the Dawes Act what
    03:16
    is the impact on families as they move
    03:18
    west and what were ways the government
    03:21
    encouraged expansion well you the
    03:22
    Homestead Act from 1862 which provided
    03:25
    160 acres of land and you also have
    03:27
    railroad subsidies to railroad companies
    03:29
    which encourage them to build railroad
    03:32
    these are just a few of the possible
    03:33
    answer choices you may see but
    03:36
    definitely be familiar with this
    03:38
    painting all right let's go over to the
    03:40
    Wilmot Proviso it was an amendment that
    03:43
    was to a bill that was authored by David
    03:46
    Wilmot it proposed banning slavery in
    03:48
    the Mexican Cession lands what exactly
    03:51
    did it say that provided that as an
    03:54
    Express and fundamental condition to the
    03:56
    acquisition of any territory from the
    03:59
    Republic of Mexico by the United States
    04:01
    so it's talking about any land the u.s.
    04:03
    gains from the mexican-american war by
    04:05
    virtue of any treaty which may be
    04:07
    negotiated between them and to the use
    04:10
    of by the executive of the money's here
    04:13
    and appropriated neither slavery nor
    04:15
    involuntary servitude shall ever exist
    04:18
    in any part of said territory except for
    04:22
    crime whereof the party shall first be
    04:25
    duly convicted what is
    04:27

    04:31
    Cession
    04:31
    land from that territory so possible
    04:34
    multiple choice and short answer tips
    04:36
    what was the impact of the
    04:37
    mexican-american war on that your answer
    04:39
    will be something along the lines of
    04:41
    increased tensions over slavery this is
    04:44
    an example of heated controversy over
    04:46
    slavery in the newly acquired
    04:49
    territories taken directly from the new
    04:51
    curriculum all right let's look at this
    04:54
    famous political cartoon and this is in
    04:56
    response to the kansas-nebraska act so
    04:58
    what do we know slots going on here
    05:00
    we'll break it all down well there are
    05:02
    four different sayers one there's
    05:04
    another there's three there's four and
    05:05
    they're standing two of them are
    05:07
    standing on a platform this is the
    05:08
    Democratic platform you notice this is
    05:10
    kansas and cuba underneath there as well
    05:13
    so we've stephen douglas he is shopping
    05:16
    this black man down the throat of a free
    05:18
    soiler with the help of franklin pierce
    05:21
    who goes on to become president now the
    05:24
    free soiler is being held down by james
    05:26
    buchanan who also goes on to be
    05:28
    president and lewis cass who ran for
    05:30
    president all four of them were
    05:32
    Democrats and again as I mentioned a
    05:34
    slave is being forced down a throat of a
    05:37
    Free Soilers somebody who was against
    05:39
    the expansion of slavery west what are
    05:42
    the implications of the cartoon while
    05:44
    the kansas-nebraska act is seen as
    05:46
    negative and the Democratic Party is the
    05:49
    culprit in this cartoon so what are some
    05:52
    possible multiple choice and short
    05:54
    answer tips
    05:55
    well the kansas-nebraska Act was a
    05:57
    proposal to settle the issue of slavery
    06:00
    in territories now Kansas Nebraska
    06:01
    specifically mentioned in the new
    06:03
    curriculum again the purpose of this was
    06:06
    to settle the issue of slavery in the
    06:08
    territories it does not by any mean
    06:10
    settlement it overturns the Missouri
    06:12
    Compromise and it leads to popular
    06:15
    sovereignty in both Kansas and Nebraska
    06:18
    again popular sovereignty is the idea
    06:20
    that individuals living in a territory
    06:23
    get to decide whether a territory is
    06:25
    free or slave in violence would soon
    06:29
    emerge in bleed in Kansas and this was
    06:32
    essentially a mini civil war going on in
    06:34
    Kansas in the 1850s okay let's talk
    06:38
    about the caning of Charles Sumner
    06:39
    chances are you seen this picture
    06:41
    as well so why did this happen well
    06:43
    Charles Sumner criticized slavery and
    06:45
    its supporters especially a fellow
    06:47
    senator by the name of Andrew Butler now
    06:50
    Butler's nephew congressman Preston
    06:52
    Brooks took exception to Sumner speech
    06:55
    he was very upset he was a member of the
    06:57
    House of Representatives he couldn't
    06:58
    believe that some nerve was talking
    07:01
    smack about his uncle so he went in and
    07:03
    just beat the living crap out of some
    07:05
    nerve so what are some possible multiple
    07:07
    choice and short answer tips an
    07:09
    important thing to realize is that is
    07:10
    that this shows the breaking down of
    07:12
    trust between leaders and the national
    07:15
    government and it also demonstrates
    07:17
    tensions between north and south it is a
    07:20
    theme of period five and this helped
    07:23
    inspire violent abolitionism and
    07:26
    although John Brown is not specifically
    07:28
    mentioned in the new curriculum this
    07:29
    violent abolitionism is and John Brown
    07:32
    hits the canvas and Pottawatomie Creek
    07:34
    he kills five people there and then also
    07:36
    later heads to Harpers Ferry to try to
    07:38
    incite a slave rebellion let's go to the
    07:40
    election of 1860 specifically mention in
    07:43
    the new curriculum what do we notice
    07:44
    about this map well Lincoln is in this
    07:46
    pinkish orange color and he wins without
    07:49
    carrying a single southern state look at
    07:52
    these states here not a single state
    07:55
    that has slavery voted for Lincoln the
    07:58
    Democratic Party was split along
    08:00
    sectional lines in the north you had
    08:03
    individuals voting for Stephen Douglas
    08:05
    who only won one state Missouri and in
    08:08
    the south you have Democrats voting for
    08:10
    John C Breckinridge who was a former
    08:12
    vice president so what are some multiple
    08:15
    choice and short answer tips definitely
    08:17
    absolutely know that Lincoln campaigned
    08:19
    on a free soil platform this is
    08:21
    specifically mentioned which means the
    08:23
    non extension of slavery so and his I
    08:25
    slavery was fine where it is but he
    08:27
    would not allow it to expand what
    08:30
    definitely be familiar with the impact
    08:32
    of the election which is that southern
    08:34
    states began to secede from the union
    08:36
    even before Lincoln became president on
    08:38
    December 20th night 1860 South Carolina
    08:43
    was the first state to secede from the
    08:45
    union okay
    08:47
    Lincoln wrote this very famous letter to
    08:49
    a newspaper editor Horace Greeley and he
    08:52
    wrote on April 22nd
    08:54
    1862 and they were any row I would save
    08:57
    the Union
    08:58
    I would save it the shortest way under
    09:00
    the Constitution the sooner the National
    09:02
    Authority could be restored the nearer
    09:04
    the Union will be the Union as it was if
    09:07
    there be those who would not save the
    09:09
    Union unless they could at the same time
    09:12
    save slavery I do not agree with that if
    09:14
    there be those who would not save the
    09:16
    Union unless they could at the same time
    09:18
    destroy slavery I do not agree with that
    09:20
    by paramount object in this struggle is
    09:23
    to save the Union and is not either to
    09:27
    save or to destroy slavery so what's the
    09:29
    message of Lincoln's excerpt here in the
    09:33
    beginning absolutely no that's the
    09:35
    beginning of the Civil War he sought to
    09:36
    preserve the Union at all costs slavery
    09:39
    came secondary what are some multiple
    09:41
    choice and short answer tips be familiar
    09:44
    with how Lincoln's war goals changed as
    09:47
    time elapsed again in the beginning he
    09:49
    was fighting the civil war to preserve
    09:51
    the Union after the Emancipation
    09:53
    Proclamation the golden war starts to
    09:56
    change to end slavery and you see this
    09:58
    at the emancipation proclamation and
    10:00
    also the Gettysburg Address this higher
    10:02
    cause that he is calling for okay here's
    10:06
    a political cartoon titled the first
    10:08
    vote from 1867 and this deals with the
    10:10
    Fifteenth Amendment what do we notice we
    10:12
    see african-american males are lining up
    10:15
    to vote and we notice that there is a
    10:17
    military official the third African
    10:19
    American back and this is an example the
    10:21
    impact of the Emancipation Proclamation
    10:23
    which allowed African Americans to
    10:25
    served in the military what are the
    10:27
    implications of the cartoon black
    10:29
    suffrage is seen as positive here and
    10:31
    some multiple choice and short answer
    10:33
    question tips be familiar with different
    10:35
    ways that the southern states resisted
    10:38
    the Fifteenth Amendment whether it's
    10:40
    through literacy test poll taxes
    10:41
    grandfather clauses etc and what were
    10:44
    the impacts of this amendment on the
    10:46
    women's rights groups and that was it
    10:48
    essentially split the group some women
    10:51
    favored black suffrage first other women
    10:54
    did not favor black suffrage unless it
    10:56
    was tied to women's suffrage as well
    10:58
    okay continuing with reconstruction we
    11:01
    have this political cartoon which deals
    11:03
    with resistance to civil rights Oh what
    11:05
    do we notice well you get the cake
    11:08
    in the white League they're joining
    11:09
    hands and underneath their hands there's
    11:12
    a skull and bones and it says worse than
    11:14
    slavery so where are the implications of
    11:16
    the cartoon the KKK the white League and
    11:18
    other organizations terrorized
    11:21
    african-americans and they would use
    11:22
    violence to meet their goals you see the
    11:25
    KKK member has a gun and knife and the
    11:28
    white League member has been attached to
    11:30
    a rifle so what are some multiple choice
    11:32
    and short answer tips organizations were
    11:35
    formed to resist the 13th through 15th
    11:37
    amendments and southern resistance to
    11:39
    Radical Republicans and reconstruction
    11:42
    was strong there were many Southerners
    11:44
    who resisted these drastic changes in
    11:47
    the south during Reconstruction okay now
    11:50
    it's your turn I will finish up with
    11:52
    this last document I would like you to
    11:55

    00:04
    hey what's going on ap people we have a
    00:06
    quick video for you today on manifest
    00:09
    destiny one of the biggest topics from
    00:11
    the mid 19th century and one of the
    00:13
    causes of the Civil War as you will see
    00:16
    so let's get started alright let's talk
    00:17
    about what manifest destiny is well it's
    00:20
    the belief that it was America's
    00:21
    god-given right to expand from coast to
    00:24
    coast to go all the way from the
    00:25
    Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean here
    00:28
    is a very popular well-known political
    00:31
    cartoon or painting I should say that
    00:34
    depicts manifest destiny you see an
    00:36
    angel here going across and you see all
    00:39
    these people moving to the left or to
    00:41
    the west on a map you can see lots of
    00:44
    people packing up and moving out west
    00:46
    and this was a term that was created by
    00:48
    a newspaper journalist John Sullivan so
    00:54
    what time period is it associated with
    00:55
    well well it's usually associated with
    00:57
    the 1840s in the 1850 so in the decade
    01:00
    or two before the Civil War however it
    01:03
    does have roots in the Louisiana
    01:04
    Purchase in the Indian Removal Act
    01:06
    remember the Louisiana Purchase was in
    01:08
    1803 and that doubled the size of the US
    01:11
    so that the u.s. was getting closer to
    01:13
    the Pacific Ocean
    01:14
    so some key associations with manifest
    01:16
    destiny you should know first one is
    01:18
    Oregon the second one is Texas and the
    01:21
    third one is the mexican-american war
    01:24
    we'll talk about each one of those
    01:25
    beginning with Oregon so one time four
    01:28
    different countries are going to claim
    01:30
    the Oregon Territory we have Spain
    01:32
    Britain Russia and the US now over time
    01:36
    two of these countries will bow out of
    01:38
    there and that includes Spain and Russia
    01:40
    so we're just left with Britain in the
    01:42
    United States and the boundary was not
    01:45
    settled between the US and Great Britain
    01:46
    who is in Canada at that time so
    01:50
    President Polk when he was running for
    01:51
    president in 1844 campaigned on a slogan
    01:54
    54:40 or fight meaning that the u.s. won
    01:57
    it up to the 54th parallel or they would
    02:00
    fight Great Britain however two years
    02:03
    later in office the two sides settle on
    02:05
    the 49th parallel so let's take a look
    02:07
    at this everything in yellow is the
    02:09
    Oregon Territory way up here is the
    02:12
    54:40 and
    02:13
    in Polk wanted every single little bit
    02:16
    of this that's in yellow up here
    02:17
    eventually the the two sides settle on
    02:20
    the 49th parallel and it continues the
    02:23
    northern boundary between Canada and the
    02:24
    United States at the 49th parallel in
    02:27
    the US does gain most of this yellow
    02:29
    Oregon territory but not the full thing
    02:31
    that Polk campaigned on let's do a quick
    02:34
    recap of Texas in 1836 Texas declared
    02:37
    independence from Mexico and in 1854 t4
    02:41
    presidential campaign the number one
    02:43
    issue was Texas and it's between these
    02:47
    two people Henry Clay in James Katie
    02:49
    Polk take a million think who do you
    02:51
    that think has worse hair here goes clay
    02:55
    because I think mullets are making a
    02:56
    comeback and they're pretty sweet
    02:57
    haircuts but clays is like somebody put
    02:59
    a bowl on his head and just cut around
    03:01
    it so no this that Democrats a favorite
    03:04
    expansion and James K poke from the
    03:06
    beginning advocated the annexation of
    03:08
    Texas Henry Clay what ultimately
    03:10
    probably did him in and why lost
    03:13
    election was that he flip-flopped on the
    03:14
    issue of Texas came out said he was
    03:17
    against it then about a week later he
    03:18
    said no no I'm for and most Americans
    03:21
    were certainly a lot of them were in
    03:22
    favor of the annexation of Texas so that
    03:25
    probably is why Paul comes on point in
    03:27
    1844 election in 1845 Texas is annexed
    03:32
    via a joint resolution a treaty is
    03:35
    normally how land is added and that
    03:36
    would require two-thirds of the Senate
    03:39
    to approve an a joint resolution simply
    03:41
    requires more than half both the House
    03:44
    and the Senate to approve it southerners
    03:46
    favored the admission of Texas as a way
    03:48
    to expand slavery and the boundary was
    03:51
    not settled by both the US and Mexico so
    03:54
    everywhere that's in green is kind of
    03:55
    this disputed territory especially down
    03:57
    here between the noices River in the Rio
    04:00
    Grande River this is going to be a huge
    04:02
    cause of the mexican-american war
    04:04
    because both sides are going to clean
    04:06
    this land down here this helps lead to
    04:09
    the I just said a mexican-american war
    04:12
    so talk about some causes well the
    04:14
    number one cause is this Texas boundary
    04:16
    issue another one is that Mexican and
    04:18
    American soldiers fight in that disputed
    04:21
    territory and President Polk claims that
    04:23
    there's American blood that was spilled
    04:25
    on Americans
    04:27
    so some effects America ends up pointing
    04:29
    the u.s. gains and Mexican Cession let's
    04:31
    take a look at this map and you'll
    04:33
    notice that all of this land over here
    04:35
    in the dark gray is gained by the u.s.
    04:37
    not this dark dark gray almost black
    04:39
    color down here that's the guest and
    04:41
    purchase that comes later but this chunk
    04:43
    of land right here the u.s. gains and it
    04:46
    increases the size of the US by one
    04:48
    third and now after the mexican-american
    04:51
    war the u.s. is fully expanded from the
    04:54
    Atlantic to the Pacific and manifest
    04:56
    destiny is essentially complete the
    05:00
    other thing that is in effect is that
    05:02
    slavery would be the number one topic
    05:04
    for the next 15 years until the Civil
    05:06
    War and one example of this is the
    05:10
    Wilmot Proviso which occurs during and
    05:12
    after the mexican-american war has
    05:15
    introduced actually several times into
    05:17
    Congress by this guy David Wilmot he
    05:19
    wanted to keep slavery out of the
    05:21
    Mexican Cession so this was a bill that
    05:23
    was introduced into Congress several
    05:25
    times it passes the house multiple times
    05:28
    but it never passes the Senate because
    05:30
    the south rejects it the senators from
    05:32
    the South rejected so this never becomes
    05:34
    a law but these ideas will really but
    05:37
    this idea will really stick around for a
    05:39
    long time many people will try to keep
    05:41
    the Mexican Cession land free from
    05:43
    slavery
    05:44
    all right impacts a manifest destiny
    05:46
    let's talk about Native Americans
    05:47
    unfortunately for them they continually
    05:49
    lost land and were pushed further and
    05:51
    further west this really began with the
    05:54
    Trail of Tears in 1838 the Indian
    05:56
    Removal Act of 1830 and eventually later
    05:59
    on in the 19th century they're going to
    06:01
    be forced on reservations and their way
    06:03
    of life is going to be completely
    06:04
    changed the impacts of manifest destiny
    06:07
    and slavery as I mentioned thrust the
    06:10
    issue of slavery into the national
    06:11
    spotlight it really became the number
    06:13
    one issue leading up to the Civil War
    06:15
    this is because there's a debate about
    06:17
    whether this new land should be free or
    06:19
    slave talk about the impacts on politics
    06:22
    I mentioned the Wilmot Proviso
    06:23
    we also have the birth of a new
    06:25
    political party in the 1850s the
    06:27
    Republican Party the first Republican
    06:30
    President was Abe Lincoln one of the
    06:32
    platform's of the Republican Party was
    06:34
    to keep slavery from expanding please
    06:37
    know this guy's Abe Lincoln the
    06:39
    not campaign on abolishing slavery
    06:41
    rather he campaigned on keeping slavery
    06:44
    from expanding it was fine where it was
    06:46
    but it better not spread whatsoever all
    06:49

    00:00
    hey what's going on in AP World we have
    00:02
    the mexican-american war review video
    00:04
    for you today it's a very important war
    00:06
    in US history and a few things you need
    00:08
    to know about it I will cover them all
    00:09
    everything you need to know for your
    00:10
    apush exam alright to understand the
    00:13
    mexican-american war we have to go back
    00:14
    a little bit to this idea of manifest
    00:16
    destiny this is a very important idea
    00:18
    that you will need to be familiar with
    00:19
    if you're not already it is the belief
    00:21
    that the US had a mandate or a direction
    00:23
    from God to expand from coast to coast
    00:25
    here is a very famous painting of
    00:28
    manifest destiny you see lots of people
    00:30
    in their Conestoga wagons moving out
    00:32
    west and there's an angel above them
    00:34
    kind of guiding the way so many
    00:36
    Americans believe during the mid-1800s
    00:38
    that America had the god-given right to
    00:41
    expand from coast to coast and this is
    00:43
    going to lead to issues as we will see
    00:45
    and the South generally favored westward
    00:48
    expansion and they did so because it
    00:50
    would be more land for them and they
    00:52
    could spread slavery further out west
    00:54
    okay some events that are leading up to
    00:56
    the mexican-american war we're gonna
    00:58
    start with the election of 1844
    01:00
    one of my favorite presidential
    01:01
    elections we have Henry Clay over here
    01:03
    the wake candidate this is the third
    01:05
    time he runs for the President and loses
    01:07
    all three of them very sadly and he's
    01:10
    going up against a dark horse candidate
    01:12
    or candidate that nobody really saw
    01:14
    coming and that was James K Polk who was
    01:16
    a Democrat his nickname was young
    01:17
    chicory because he was Andrew Jackson's
    01:20
    protege Polk embraced the idea of
    01:23
    manifest destiny he was all about it did
    01:26
    not hide from it and he was in favor of
    01:27
    the annexation of Texas Henry Clay was
    01:30
    flip-flopping on the issue of Texas
    01:33
    whether or not Texas should join the
    01:34
    Union and for that reason he pretty much
    01:37
    lost the election of 1844
    01:39
    I'm sadly James K Polk woods we have
    01:43
    something called the Slidell mission
    01:44
    what James K Polk does is he sends a guy
    01:46
    by the name of Slidell believe it or not
    01:48
    to purchase California to go to Mexico
    01:50
    to purchase California and help settle
    01:52
    the boundary dispute along the Texas
    01:53
    border which we'll talk about in just a
    01:55
    moment Mexico refuses to even hear this
    01:57
    guy talk he sends him back and Polk
    01:59
    failed in his hope of purchasing
    02:02
    California on April 25th 1846 Mexico
    02:06
    attacks all US troops on us quotes soil
    02:10
    and if you look at this map here here's
    02:12
    Texas now
    02:13
    when Texas declared independence the
    02:15
    yellow is pretty much what Mexico
    02:18
    recognizes the Texas border the green
    02:20
    area is all this disputed territory
    02:22
    claimed by both Mexico and Texas the US
    02:26
    when they annexed Texas for the most
    02:29
    part assumed that all the green was part
    02:31
    of them as well so where this happens is
    02:33
    Mexico attacking the US troops on the US
    02:36
    soil happens right between the noisiest
    02:38
    River in the Rio Grande River what
    02:41
    Mexico said was the noisiest River would
    02:43
    be the southern boundary for Texas and
    02:44
    Texas said no the Rio Grande would so
    02:46
    all this green area is the disputed
    02:48
    territory so where Mexico attack was in
    02:51
    between these two rivers on disputed
    02:53
    territory this leads to some people in
    02:55
    Congress to want to know the exact spot
    02:58
    of where this attack was and most
    03:00
    notably was Abe Lincoln he could have
    03:02
    made his name he was a freshman member
    03:04
    of the House of Representatives and he
    03:07
    wanted to know the exact location of
    03:09
    where the war started a very important
    03:13
    battle that you will need to know is the
    03:14
    battle buona Vista this is where Jeff
    03:15
    general Zachary Taylor becomes a hero
    03:17
    and then this helps catapult him into
    03:20
    the presidency in 1848 and sadly this is
    03:22
    also where Henry Clay's son dies Henry
    03:25
    Clay jr. in this battle the Treaty of
    03:27
    Guadalupe Hidalgo ends the
    03:29
    mexican-american war the u.s. gains a
    03:31
    lot they gain California areas of
    03:33
    modern-day New Mexico Arizona Utah
    03:35
    Nevada and hat which is half of the
    03:37
    Mexican territory if you look here again
    03:40
    this gray area is what Texas had already
    03:42
    claimed but all this dark gray area here
    03:45
    is from the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
    03:47
    and then we're gonna have a little issue
    03:49
    over here in the compromise of 1850
    03:50
    Texas is claiming this area here so if
    03:53
    you want to know more about this so
    03:54
    watch my video on key compromises in US
    03:57
    history you need to know in the u.s.
    03:59
    pays Mexico 15 million dollars now if
    04:01
    you want to know about this little bit
    04:03
    of land called theme gets then purchase
    04:05
    check out Jimmy Fallon's get just Google
    04:07
    Jimmy Fallon guests and purchase they
    04:09
    also do a little bit on the Treaty of
    04:11
    Guadalupe Hidalgo it is about five
    04:13
    minutes of some of the funniest stuff
    04:14
    you'll ever see on TV and watch this
    04:16
    guy's face the whole time he makes weird
    04:18
    faces okay some effects of the war
    04:19
    America the size of America is increased
    04:22
    by one-third so again all this land that
    04:25
    they gained and pretty much now that you
    04:27
    expanding from coast to coast they
    04:28
    fulfilled their destiny of manifest
    04:31
    destiny future generals emerged from
    04:33
    this war including this guy ulysses s
    04:35
    grant and robert e lee who will face off
    04:37
    against each other during the Civil War
    04:39
    the debate over slavery continues that
    04:42
    intensifies being one of the most
    04:44
    important things you'll need to know is
    04:46
    the Wilmot Proviso this Democrat from
    04:49
    Pennsylvania David wama introduces this
    04:52
    bill or amendment to a bill that says
    04:53
    any land gained from Mexico should be
    04:55
    free of slavery and this is going to
    04:57
    just set off a firestorm in Congress and
    05:00
    the South is going to hate this never
    05:03
    ever passes Congress but it does that
    05:06
    it's ideas are taken by a political
    05:08
    party called the Free Soilers and then
    05:10
    we have the compromise of 1850 which I
    05:12
    touched on a little bit earlier this is
    05:13
    going to settle the admission of all
    05:15
    that land basically they're going to
    05:17
    introduce popular sovereignty or the
    05:18
    idea that the people the territories
    05:20
    could vote whether it'll be slave or
    05:21
    free again if you want more info on the
    05:23
    compromise of 1850 check out my video
    05:26
    key compromises in US history ok that's
    05:29
    it for the mexican-american war if
    05:31
    you're ever in Illinois and you want to
    05:33
    see Santa Anna's leg he was the Mexican
    05:35
    general during the in leader during the
    05:37
    mexican-american war his leg was
    05:39
    actually stolen by an Illinois regiment
    05:41
    in a battle so here is his wooden leg
    05:43
    true story when he lost his real leg it
    05:46
    was in 1837 I believe he actually had a
    05:49
    funeral for his leg so this guy was a
    05:51
    bit of a egomaniac but if you want your
    05:54
    ever know knowing what is he's like

    00:02
    hey what's going on in AP World we have
    00:04
    a video for you today an old immigration
    00:07
    so that's pre Civil War immigration and
    00:09
    nativism a very popular topic for the AP
    00:12
    exam if you want to download this
    00:14
    powerpoint to go along with the video
    00:16
    please follow the link in the
    00:17
    description to go to a push review com
    00:20
    to download this alright let's talk
    00:22
    about what is old immigration exactly
    00:25
    well they're immigrants that came from
    00:26
    northern and western Europe and some
    00:29
    specific countries they came from were
    00:31
    Ireland Germany and England and this
    00:34
    occurred between the 1820s in the 1870s
    00:37
    but really most of it occur between the
    00:39
    1820s and these civil war very popular
    00:42
    question something that you guys should
    00:43
    definitely know there are two groups
    00:45
    that made up the most amount of
    00:47
    immigrants prior to the Civil War and
    00:49
    and they were the Irish and the Germans
    00:51
    but the one group the largest group
    00:54
    prior to the Civil War and this has been
    00:56
    a question on the AP exam before is the
    00:59
    Irish so please be aware that we'll talk
    01:01
    about why the Irish are coming prior to
    01:03
    the Civil War okay so why did they come
    01:06
    here and where did they settle well
    01:08
    Germans tended to be farmers that were
    01:11
    looking for land and Irish people tended
    01:13
    to come here because of the Irish potato
    01:15
    famine in the 1840s which is also known
    01:17
    as the black 40's and there is a potato
    01:20
    that is infected with the disease potato
    01:23
    blight which infected many potatoes and
    01:26
    Ireland during that time and if you look
    01:29
    at the population fall in Ireland
    01:30
    between 1841 and 1851 the darker the
    01:34
    color red the higher the percentage of
    01:36
    people that were leaving Ireland so
    01:38
    virtually everywhere in Ireland you can
    01:40
    see people were leaving the destination
    01:43
    that the highest amount of Irish went to
    01:45
    was America and the Irish tended to
    01:47
    settle in large cities in the Northeast
    01:49
    such as Boston and New York so where did
    01:51
    they settle well we just talked about
    01:53
    the Irish and the Germans tended to
    01:55
    settle on the frontier in the Midwest
    01:57
    and the northwest so you see places like
    01:59
    Ohio and Wisconsin and they also get
    02:03
    many contributions to American society
    02:05
    including the idea of kindergarten or
    02:07
    children's garden where education was
    02:09
    very important for Germans
    02:12
    okay let's talk about this term nativism
    02:15
    and this is a fear distrust and hatred
    02:17
    of foreigners and there's going to be
    02:19
    lots of reasons for this one we have
    02:21
    different cultures and keep in mind
    02:22
    these arguments whether we're talking
    02:24
    about the 1830s and 1840s or the 1920s
    02:28
    or even today you'll see the same
    02:29
    arguments used over and over by people
    02:31
    about why immigration is bad people are
    02:35
    speaking different languages religion is
    02:37
    going to play a huge role here you see
    02:39
    that the Irish were mostly Catholic and
    02:41
    that is going to concern a lot of
    02:43
    Protestants living in America Catholics
    02:45
    were discriminating against for so long
    02:47
    the JFK is the first president ever that
    02:51
    was Catholic and there's this accusation
    02:54
    that Irish and Germans would steal
    02:56
    elections both of these groups
    02:57
    particularly in the Irish tended to vote
    02:59
    for Democrats so if you were not a
    03:01
    Democrat you would be upset with the
    03:03
    immigrants who would vote overwhelmingly
    03:05
    in favor of the Democratic Party and you
    03:09
    see this in Tammany Hall in New York
    03:11
    City especially in the later 1800s with
    03:13
    boss tweed and there's also an
    03:16
    accusation that immigrants took a job so
    03:18
    look let's look at this old help-wanted
    03:21
    ad from a newspaper this is talking
    03:23
    about a person 16 to 18 years of age
    03:26
    helping to help out with stuff and then
    03:28
    it says no Irish need apply or Nena and
    03:32
    this would be seen in in store windows
    03:34
    and newspapers you name it people did
    03:36
    not want to hire Irish immigrants and
    03:39
    many people dislike the Irish immigrants
    03:41
    at this time because they worked for
    03:43
    less money than what Americans would
    03:46
    work for and they also would not
    03:48
    unionize and will specially see that
    03:49
    later with new immigration but that's
    03:51
    for a different video okay so we're
    03:53
    going to talk about that know-nothing
    03:54
    party this is a political party that was
    03:56
    formed to to nativism they originated as
    03:59
    the Supreme order of the star-spangled
    04:01
    banner' that was their name and they
    04:03
    wanted to ban Catholics from holding
    04:05
    office so they would especially distrust
    04:08
    and dislike Irish immigrants because
    04:10
    Irish immigrants tended to be Catholic
    04:12
    and they call for tougher immigration
    04:14
    and naturalization laws making it harder
    04:16
    for immigrants to become citizens and in
    04:20
    1856 then ex-president Millard Fillmore
    04:23
    ran for the president of the note
    04:25
    think partying here is a poster
    04:28
    depicting that and this is actually
    04:29
    Andrew Jackson's nephew his name was
    04:32
    Andrew Jackson Donaldson he was Adrian's
    04:34
    personal secretary one he was president
    04:36
    and in 1856 Millard Fillmore and
    04:40
    Donaldson got 21 percent of the popular
    04:42
    vote so so one-fifth of people who voted
    04:45
    in the election voted for the
    04:47
    know-nothing party that just shows how
    04:49
    high nativism was during this time and
    04:52
    by 1861 that some Wars going on there
    04:54
    really no longer a political threat so
    04:56
    this is a short-lived political party we
    05:00
    even see different companies jump on the
    05:02
    bandwagon of the know-nothings and this
    05:04
    is a soap company and it's know-nothing
    05:06
    soap so you see nativism creeping into
    05:08
    many areas of American life all right
    05:12
    that's it for me and the old immigration
    05:14
    and nativism if you guys have any

    00:02
    hey what's going on ap world we have a
    00:05
    video for you today and famous
    00:06
    abolitionists to know and it's important
    00:09
    to note that there are literally
    00:10
    thousands of abolitionists but I'm only
    00:13
    gonna focus on the really big ones that
    00:14
    are that are likely to appear on your
    00:17
    apush exams it's not to diminish the
    00:19
    work of any other individuals but just
    00:21
    ones that you should be familiar with
    00:22
    and are most likely to appear on your
    00:24
    exam so let's start off with early
    00:26
    abolition by the way abolition means to
    00:29
    get rid of slavery so we have Quakers
    00:31
    that gathered mostly in Pennsylvania
    00:33
    thanks to this guy William Penn who was
    00:35
    a Quaker and they were abolitionists
    00:38
    during the colonial era which was really
    00:40
    really unique at the time not many
    00:42
    people were outspoken against slavery
    00:44
    another early form of abolitionism is
    00:47
    the American Colonization Society which
    00:49
    was founded in 1817 and the goal of this
    00:53
    society was to send former slaves or
    00:55
    freed slaves to Africa and specifically
    00:58
    Liberia prominent members included Henry
    01:02
    Clay in Abraham Lincoln early on in his
    01:04
    career and many others and this was not
    01:06
    a successful organization for many
    01:08
    reasons one of which is the fact that
    01:10
    most former slaves did not want to go to
    01:13
    Africa many of these individuals only
    01:15
    knew America as their home and they and
    01:17
    they wanted to stay in America they did
    01:19
    not want to go to Africa so this
    01:21
    organization is not very successful okay
    01:25
    let's get to some specific individuals
    01:27
    you should know Harriet Beecher Stowe
    01:29
    from Cincinnati is a very important
    01:31
    abolitionist she wrote the book Uncle
    01:33
    Tom's Cabin in the 1850s it was
    01:35
    published supposedly when Abe Lincoln
    01:37
    was president he met Harriet Beecher
    01:39
    Stowe and said to her so you're the
    01:41
    little woman that started this great war
    01:44
    so there was a huge impact and what the
    01:46
    book does is it showed the evils of
    01:47
    slavery particularly when it came to
    01:50
    breaking up families and last night I
    01:52
    just saw the movie 12 years of slave
    01:53
    which is an incredible incredible movie
    01:56
    I encourage you to go watch it and one
    01:58
    of the there's many bad scenes in it but
    02:00
    one of the really gut-wrenching scenes
    02:02
    was when they they divided up a mother
    02:05
    from her two children and it was very
    02:07
    very sad and that's kind of the focus of
    02:09
    Uncle Tom's Kevin Theodore Dwight weld
    02:11
    wrote a book called Americans
    02:13
    slavery as it is he's a very active
    02:15
    member in the abolitionist movement and
    02:17
    he marries a woman named Angelina Grimke
    02:20
    may be asking yourself who is Angelina
    02:22
    Grimke well she and her sister Sarah
    02:24
    were southern women that advocated both
    02:27
    abolitionism and women's rights so this
    02:29
    was very very progressive for that time
    02:32
    to have Southern women advocate
    02:34
    abolitionism and women's rights
    02:37
    now many people were doing that at the
    02:38
    time especially southern women Harriet
    02:41
    Tubman one of the most famous
    02:42
    abolitionist she was a former slave and
    02:43
    helped other slaves escape via the
    02:45
    Underground Railroad she went back many
    02:47
    times in the south and helped free over
    02:49
    300 people she was an inspiration for
    02:52
    many many people
    02:53
    David Walker was it was an African
    02:57
    American who called for unity among
    02:58
    blacks and he called for a violent for
    03:00
    violence to end slavery as that is one
    03:03
    of the only ways to get rid of slavery
    03:05
    Elijah Lovejoy was a printer from
    03:09
    Illinois and he was also a minister and
    03:11
    he owned his own newspaper and in his
    03:13
    newspaper he focused on abolitionism and
    03:16
    he was a mob comes to his warehouse in
    03:19
    Illinois and they burned it down and in
    03:21
    the process they shoot him five times
    03:22
    with a shotgun and he is killed so he
    03:25
    becomes a martyr for the abolitionist
    03:27
    movement and he helps inspire somebody
    03:29
    by the name of John Brown who we'll talk
    03:30
    about right now John Brown was part of
    03:33
    Bleeding Kansas in the 1850s and he was
    03:35
    our katuk to the raid at Harpers Ferry
    03:37
    I'm gonna do a whole video on John Brown
    03:39
    to look for that soon this is a huge
    03:42
    immediate cause of the Civil War so
    03:45
    those are abolitionist abolitionists
    03:47
    that you should definitely know here too
    03:49
    that you absolutely positively know
    03:50
    where things are BOTS must know William
    03:52
    Lloyd Garrison published a newspaper
    03:54
    called The Liberator and he called for
    03:56
    the immediate end to slavery without
    03:58
    compensation were uncompensated that
    04:01
    means that the slave owners will not be
    04:03
    paid for the slaves that they have to
    04:06
    free he disliked the Constitution since
    04:09
    it allowed slavery and he urged
    04:11
    secession by the north he said the north
    04:13
    should break away from the south because
    04:15
    it is too corrupt and they condone
    04:17
    slavery he was very very radical for his
    04:20
    time somebody who worked with William
    04:23
    Lloyd Garrison was Frederick Douglass
    04:25
    arguably the most famous
    04:27
    former slave he was a former slave a
    04:29
    great orator and he published a
    04:31
    newspaper called the North Star he
    04:34
    traveled all around America and even
    04:36
    Europe as well to speak out against
    04:38
    slavery and he also attended the women's
    04:41
    rights movement at Seneca Falls in 1848
    04:43
    so he was a very well-known leading
    04:45
    abolitionist and also a women's rights
    04:48
    advocate as well all right those are
    04:51
    virtually all of the abolitionists that
    04:54

    00:04
    hey what's going on ATP world we have a
    00:07
    very important video for you today and
    00:08
    the compromise of 1850 a very important
    00:12
    compromise in the history of America one
    00:14
    that appears quite often let's start out
    00:16
    by looking at a very famous picture this
    00:19
    is from the compromise of 1850 you know
    00:21
    it's front and center here is Henry
    00:23
    claim he is speaking in the Senate
    00:26
    chamber introducing some of the concepts
    00:28
    of the compromise of 1850 and over here
    00:31
    is the president of the Senate and
    00:33
    according to Constitution who is the
    00:36
    president of the Senate if you said the
    00:39
    vice president you are correct and there
    00:41
    is vice president Millard Fillmore who
    00:43
    will shortly become president when
    00:45
    Zachary Taylor dies and he will support
    00:48
    Henry Clay's compromise of 1850 ok let's
    00:51
    get going we need to know some key
    00:53
    players of the compromise of 1850 and
    00:56
    the first one is Stephen Douglas
    00:58
    nicknamed the little giant he is a
    01:00
    senator from Illinois and he helped gain
    01:02
    support for the compromise he and Henry
    01:05
    Clay work hand-in-hand and really play
    01:07
    an instrumental role in getting this
    01:08
    compromise to pass and you will know him
    01:11
    from few years after this from those
    01:12
    famous lincoln-douglas debates of 1858
    01:16
    next we have John C Calhoun still
    01:18
    scary-looking very old here he actually
    01:20
    dies in 1850 he is a senator from South
    01:23
    Carolina and he wanted slavery to be
    01:25
    left completely alone he did not want it
    01:28
    to be touched or prohibited in any area
    01:30
    so he is a different view Daniel Webster
    01:33
    we remember him remember two or three of
    01:35
    the great triumvirate he is from New
    01:38
    England he gives a very famous speech to
    01:40
    set him at the March March speech I
    01:42
    would be very familiar with that and
    01:44
    it's this idea that he asked to
    01:45
    northerners to support the Fugitive
    01:48
    Slave Law which we'll talk about and to
    01:49
    compromise so he really helped many in
    01:51
    the North support the compromise of 1850
    01:53
    and in the process many abolitionists
    01:55
    turned against them they felt like he
    01:57
    sold out and finally we can not forget
    01:59
    super clay Henry Clay here he introduced
    02:02
    the compromise at age 72 what a champ
    02:05
    that guy is imagine 72 you're
    02:07
    introducing this compromise and saving
    02:09
    the Union yet again pretty impressive if
    02:11
    you ask me all right some background
    02:13
    info
    02:13
    to the compromise of 1850 it all starts
    02:16
    with the mexican-american war which
    02:17
    lasted two years from 1846 to 1847 and
    02:23
    American war famous America Ralph Waldo
    02:27
    Emerson said of Mexico at that time that
    02:30
    Mexico will poison us boy was this guy
    02:33
    correct with the Treaty of Guadalupe
    02:35
    Hidalgo which ended the mexican-american
    02:37
    war and the u.s. is going to gain all
    02:39
    this land from the Mexican Cession here
    02:41
    in 1848 not this little piece down here
    02:44
    that's the guest and purchased that will
    02:45
    come years later but the u.s. gains all
    02:48
    this land here then we have the Wilmot
    02:52
    Proviso introduced by Democrat David
    02:55
    Wilmot and what this provides a proposed
    02:58
    was that if it was past slavery would be
    03:00
    prohibited from all land gained during
    03:04
    the mexican-american war this passes the
    03:06
    house where the North has a population
    03:08
    advantage but it does not pass the
    03:10
    Senate because the the states were equal
    03:13
    between free and slave states so the
    03:15
    Senate never approves this another issue
    03:18
    is that Texas claimed land east of the
    03:20
    Rio Grande in present-day New Mexico so
    03:23
    let's look here you see well we know
    03:25
    it's present-day Texas with the these
    03:27
    two straight lines here however this
    03:30
    Arian great here east of the Rio Grande
    03:32
    Texas was claiming this all the way up
    03:34
    here they said this is our land and that
    03:37
    caused a huge huge conflict as we will
    03:39
    see so lots of stuff that needs to be
    03:42
    settled and they did threaten war they
    03:45
    said to the United States to zachary
    03:46
    taylor this is our land if you come try
    03:49
    to take it we will go to war with you so
    03:50
    the the country was really on the verge
    03:52
    of war during 1850 and the south and
    03:55
    additionally said if texas is attacked
    03:57
    we will come to texas his defense so
    03:59
    really the country was kind of staring
    04:00
    at civil war here in 1850 okay five
    04:04
    parts of compromise i can't stress
    04:05
    enough know all five of these parts if
    04:07
    you're writing an essay you want to
    04:08
    incorporate them I've seen many multiple
    04:10
    choice questions on which of the
    04:11
    following was or was not a part of the
    04:14
    compromise of 1850 so be familiar with
    04:16
    them first one California again gained
    04:19
    from the Mexican Cession California was
    04:21
    added as a free state with the
    04:23
    California Republic this tips the
    04:25
    balance in favor of priests
    04:27
    so now free states have an advantage
    04:29
    they outnumber the slave states by one
    04:31
    so they will gain an advantage in the
    04:33
    Senate the second part the slave trade
    04:36
    would be abolished in Washington DC not
    04:39
    slavery slavery remained however the
    04:42
    slave trade was abolished because many
    04:45
    northerner said it was repulsive for
    04:47
    foreign dignitaries to come to
    04:48
    Washington DC and see human beings being
    04:51
    sold into slavery they abolished the
    04:53
    trade but not slavery a very important
    04:56
    concept that will be throughout the
    04:58
    eighteen fifties is this idea of popular
    04:59
    sovereignty and this was to be used in
    05:02
    land gained from the Mexican Cession so
    05:04
    your Utah New Mexican territories C New
    05:07
    Mexico and purple and Utah here these
    05:09
    two popular sovereignty will be used
    05:11
    here now what does that mean that is
    05:13
    that those living in the territories
    05:15
    could decide the status of slavery that
    05:18
    is your citizens the people living here
    05:20
    so the people in New Mexico wanted
    05:23
    slavery they would vote on it the people
    05:24
    in Virginia or Pennsylvania they would
    05:27
    have no say of their slavery in New
    05:29
    Mexico according to popular sovereignty
    05:31
    it's the people that live there and this
    05:33
    will be again as I mentioned a common
    05:35
    theme in 1850s a very important aspect
    05:39
    of the compromise of 1850 is a more
    05:41
    strict Fugitive Slave Act and this will
    05:43
    infuriate northerners this is the one
    05:46
    that the South really fought for and guy
    05:48
    and this turns many Northerners into
    05:50
    abolitionists they are very upset and
    05:53
    they're upset because it requires
    05:54
    northerners to aid in catching and the
    05:57
    return of slaves they had to take an
    05:59
    active role no longer because they just
    06:01
    kind of sat back and watched laser on
    06:02
    the way this required their involvement
    06:04
    and many states began to pass what are
    06:07
    called personal liberty laws which we'll
    06:09
    talk about in just a few minutes and
    06:11
    finally the fifth part of this Texas has
    06:14
    paid ten million dollars they were in a
    06:16
    lot of debt from when they were their
    06:17
    own independent country and they're paid
    06:20
    ten million dollars to settle the border
    06:21
    dispute so this land over here they give
    06:24
    up in exchange for ten million dollars
    06:27
    okay let's talk about the impact of the
    06:30
    compromise there are huge tensions in
    06:32
    Congress that are demonstrated during
    06:34
    this time period and again a sign of
    06:36
    things to come we have two key players
    06:38
    here this guy here is Thomas Hart Benton
    06:40
    is a senator
    06:41
    from Missouri is actually Centre for
    06:43
    over 30 years over here we have another
    06:45
    senator from the South last name foot fo
    06:47
    OTE they get so heated in the Senate
    06:52
    that foot actually pulls a gun on Thomas
    06:55
    Hart Benton in charges that I mean
    06:56
    Thomas Hart Benton screams out let the
    06:59
    assassin fire so in the Senate you have
    07:02
    senators pulling guns on each other
    07:04
    that's how tense these debates got
    07:05
    you'll see this again with the caning of
    07:08
    Charles Sumner in 1850 that the northern
    07:11
    and southern tensions were so high that
    07:12
    even congressmen were fighting or
    07:14
    threatening to kill each other
    07:16
    civil wars absolutely positively averted
    07:20
    and many historians will point to that
    07:21
    this was a good thing the reason why the
    07:23
    compromise of 1850 was good was because
    07:25
    it gave the north ten more years to
    07:27
    industrialized and the fact that 1850
    07:30
    many Northerners if secession happened
    07:31
    would not have supported civil war they
    07:33
    kind of would have let the South just go
    07:36
    away and break into its own independent
    07:37
    country because of those personal
    07:40
    liberty laws which required the North to
    07:42
    become more involved in the catchiest
    07:44
    lays many in the North moved towards the
    07:46
    abolitionist movement many people who
    07:48
    were not abolitionists become
    07:50
    abolitionists as a result personal
    07:53
    liberty laws are not enforced in the
    07:56
    North whatsoever you actually have some
    07:57
    states passed laws that go directly
    07:58
    against them and that is essentially
    08:01
    nullification from the northern view
    08:02
    here so again this compromise requires
    08:04
    many Northerners to move towards the
    08:06
    abolitionist movement okay we'll finish
    08:08
    up with some past essay topics and these
    08:10
    are the same that I left you with in the
    08:12
    video on the Compromise of 1820 and the
    08:14
    reason why is because of a lot of these
    08:15
    dates begin with the 1820 compromise and
    08:19
    and a tour around the compromise of 1850
    08:22
    so analyze the effectiveness of
    08:24
    political compromise and reducing
    08:25
    sectional type tensions in the period
    08:28
    1822 1861 from the 2004 free response if
    08:32
    you if you are familiar with the
    08:33
    Compromise of 1820 and the compromise of
    08:35
    1850 you have quite a bit of an essay
    08:37
    there from the 2005 form beat DBQ in the
    08:41
    early 19th century Americans sought to
    08:43
    resolve their political disputes through
    08:44
    compromise yet by 1860 this no longer
    08:47
    seemed possible
    08:48
    analyze the reasons for this change use
    08:50
    the documents in your knowledge from the
    08:52
    period 1820 to 1860 in constructing your
    08:55
    response there's one major Cepero as i
    08:57
    haven't done yet and that the
    08:58
    kansas-nebraska act but look for that
    09:00
    you do these three compromises 1820 1850
    09:03
    in Kansas Nebraska you'll be absolutely
    09:05
    able to answer all three of these and
    09:06
    finally analyzed how westward expansion
    09:08
    contributed to growing sectional
    09:10
    tensions between the north and south can
    09:12
    find your answer to the period from 1800
    09:14
    to 1850 so get in 1803 with the
    09:17
    Louisiana Purchase and from 1846 to
    09:19
    80-48 you had the mexican-american war
    09:22
    and then you can explain how those two
    09:24
    things caused tension between the north
    09:26
    and the south
    09:28
    all right that's everything you need to
    09:30
    know about the compromise of 1850 I hope
    09:32
    that helped please take a moment to my

    00:02
    hey what's going on ap guys we have a
    00:05
    video for you today I'm bleeding Kansas
    00:08
    one of the causes of the Civil War and
    00:11
    all sorts of chaos going on in Kansas in
    00:13
    the 1850s so let's get going now let's
    00:15
    go back a little bit to the
    00:16
    kansas-nebraska Act which was passed in
    00:19
    1854 and this was a law that allowed for
    00:22
    popular sovereignty in the Kansas and
    00:24
    Nebraska territories we see this word
    00:26
    popular sovereignty what that means is
    00:29
    that the people living there in that
    00:30
    territory could decide if they want
    00:32
    slavery there or not and this was
    00:35
    devised by this guy the Little Giant
    00:37
    Stephen Douglas he was a senator from
    00:40
    Illinois he defeated Abe Lincoln in the
    00:42
    senator race in 1858 that's part of the
    00:45
    lincoln-douglas debates I do have a
    00:47
    video for that so please check the
    00:48
    description below they also played an
    00:50
    instrumental role in the compromise of
    00:53
    1850 as well so what does this
    00:55
    kansas-nebraska Act me well the
    00:58
    expectation was that Kansas would be a
    01:00
    slave state in Nebraska would be a free
    01:03
    state and this overturned the Missouri
    01:05
    Compromise of 1820 because that applied
    01:08
    to the Louisiana Purchase territory and
    01:10
    it said that nothing above that 36:30
    01:13
    line would be slave and Kansas is above
    01:16
    that 36:30 line now so many in the north
    01:19
    are upset about this they they felt that
    01:21
    the Missouri Compromise had worked well
    01:23
    for the previous 34 years and it should
    01:25
    not have been overturned and this helps
    01:28
    lead to the creation of the Republican
    01:30
    Party so let's go to Lawrence Kansas
    01:32
    this is a city in Kansas that is a free
    01:34
    soil city so a lot of people who are
    01:37
    anti-slavery moved to Lawrence Kansas
    01:39
    and what you see is a lot of people are
    01:41
    going to move into Kansas to try to sway
    01:43
    the election their way the city is
    01:45
    burned by pro-slavery individuals it's
    01:48
    called the sack of Lawrence and you can
    01:50
    see here that this city is burned and
    01:52
    destroyed people are cleaning up
    01:54
    afterwards this helped exhibit the
    01:56
    tensions in Kansas over popular
    01:58
    sovereignty and slavery so let's go to
    02:01
    this guy Charles Sumner the caning of
    02:04
    Charles Sumner so who was Charles Sumner
    02:06
    here's a picture of him he was a senator
    02:08
    from Massachusetts okay so what does he
    02:10
    have to do with bleeding Kansas well
    02:12
    there's an
    02:12
    abolitionists a very hardcore
    02:14
    abolitionist who wanted to end slavery
    02:17
    and certainly keep it from going into
    02:19
    Kansas and he gives a political speech
    02:22
    in the Senate called the crime against
    02:23
    Kansas and in this speech he criticizes
    02:26
    Douglass for authoring the
    02:28
    kansas-nebraska Act and he also
    02:30
    criticized as a senator from South
    02:32
    Carolina and Dean Butler and he says
    02:35
    some pretty harsh things about the
    02:36
    institution of slavery and Butler
    02:38
    himself we're gonna have this guy
    02:40
    Preston Brooks come into the picture and
    02:42
    Preston Brooks is related to Butler he's
    02:45
    a relative of Butler he is a member of
    02:47
    the House of Representatives he wanted
    02:50
    to defend the honor of the South of
    02:51
    South Carolina and of his relative
    02:54
    Butler as well so there's this caning
    02:57
    this this event called Dakini Brooks
    02:59
    attack Sumner while Sumner was at his
    03:01
    desk with a cane the reason why Brooks
    03:03
    has a cane is he was shot in the hip
    03:05
    during a duel and had to walk with a
    03:06
    walking cane the rest of his life so he
    03:08
    goes and he attacks Charles Sumner beats
    03:11
    him unconsciously and continues to hit
    03:13
    him in the head so hard that the top of
    03:15
    his cane actually breaks off and there
    03:17
    were a few senators who who wanted to
    03:19
    try to break it up but another senator
    03:21
    had a gun pointed at them and then said
    03:24
    let them be so this was a staged attack
    03:26
    Sumner is knocked unconscious and this
    03:29
    helps show deep tensions in Congress
    03:31
    between the north and the south
    03:33
    Brooks ends up resigning his seat and
    03:36
    gets elected again in this special
    03:38
    election so South Carolina
    03:39
    overwhelmingly votes and back in so
    03:41
    let's go to paddle with Tommy Creek John
    03:43
    Brown who becomes really famous a few
    03:45
    years later from Harpers Ferry and his
    03:47
    sons they plot revenge for the more the
    03:50
    sack of warrants and the caning of
    03:52
    Charles Sumner so here's John Brown
    03:53
    about this time in the mid 1850s he had
    03:56
    a lot of a lot of kids I'll be doing a
    03:57
    video later on John Brown at Harpers
    03:59
    Ferry so he and his followers and his
    04:01
    kids they killed five pro-slavery
    04:04
    individuals they actually use their
    04:05
    swords on them and they cut them into
    04:07
    pieces essentially they brutally
    04:09
    murdered these five people who are
    04:11
    pro-slavery Brown and his followers
    04:13
    leave Kansas they escape trial or being
    04:16
    caught there but he will as I said make
    04:18
    a reappearance in Harpers Ferry in a few
    04:20
    years and the fighting in Kansas
    04:22
    continues throughout the 1850s
    04:25
    so let's go to something called the
    04:26
    Lecompton Constitution be a little
    04:28
    tricky so Kansas is applying for
    04:30
    statehood to the Union voters could vote
    04:34
    for a constitution with or without
    04:36
    slavery this is the Lecompton
    04:37
    Constitution you could go in and you
    04:39
    could vote yes we want slavery no we do
    04:42
    not want slavery seems pretty
    04:44
    straightforward however if enough voters
    04:47
    if more than half that this popular
    04:49
    sovereignty works and enough voters
    04:51
    voted for the Constitution without
    04:53
    slavery those slaves that were already
    04:56
    in Kansas could stay in be slaves so
    04:59
    it's really it's a sham election it's a
    05:01
    trick that would still allow slavery to
    05:03
    exist certainly for the ones who are
    05:05
    already there so the Free Soilers to
    05:08
    people who are anti-slavery they refuse
    05:10
    to vote and even President Buchanan a
    05:13
    Democratic president who wants to try to
    05:15
    avoid tension supports the Lecompton
    05:17
    Constitution ultimately what happens is
    05:20
    this fighting continues and there's
    05:21
    there's a couple more constitutions that
    05:23
    are made to the state of Kansas in
    05:25
    Kansas does not become a state until
    05:27
    early 1861 and they enter it as a free
    05:29
    state because so many of the southern
    05:31
    states had already seceded from the
    05:33
    Union so let's talk about the impact of
    05:36
    Bleeding Kansas well the Democratic
    05:38
    Party is split along sectional lines and
    05:40
    the northern Democrats are going to
    05:42
    continue to stick with Stephen Douglas
    05:44
    that should be one s not two and if we
    05:47
    look at this map in the 1860
    05:48
    presidential election this all but
    05:50
    guarantees the Democrats would not win
    05:52
    so if you look here we have Douglass and
    05:54
    the electoral votes in one state however
    05:57
    he had the second-most popular votes so
    05:59
    the northern Democrats those that vote
    06:01
    Democrat will vote for Stephen Douglas
    06:05
    Southern Democrats will vote for
    06:07
    Breckenridge Jhansi Beckham Breckenridge
    06:09
    who is a former vice president and Abe
    06:12
    Lincoln in red is going to win the
    06:14
    election even though in many states in
    06:16
    the south he does not appear on the
    06:18
    ballot whatsoever so ultimately Abe
    06:21
    Lincoln will win this election he'll
    06:22
    become the first republican president
    06:25
    and civil war will begin shortly
    06:27

    00:02
    hey what's going on AP World we have a
    00:05
    review of one of the most important
    00:07
    court cases in US history Dred Scott vs.
    00:11
    Sanford if you're looking at Sanford and
    00:12
    you're thinking to yourself I've seen
    00:14
    that spelled two ways si and fo are d
    00:17
    and si and D fo are D that is correct
    00:21
    and the reason why is this a green court
    00:23
    misspelled Sanford during the court case
    00:26
    they spelled it with a D it's actually
    00:28
    spelled this way without a D just a
    00:30
    little fact in the day for you alright
    00:32
    so let's start talking about this case
    00:33
    who was Dred Scott well Dred Scott
    00:35
    here's a portrait of him his wife had
    00:38
    two daughters were slaves of a US
    00:41
    military doctor and his doctors and this
    00:44
    doctor's name is dr. Emerson now prior
    00:46
    to dr. Emerson's death Scott traveled
    00:49
    with him in different areas of the
    00:50
    country including Illinois which is a
    00:54
    free state in Wisconsin which is a free
    00:57
    territory so he goes into a state which
    01:00
    forbid slavery in a territory which
    01:02
    forbids slavery both of those go back to
    01:04
    the northwest land ordinance of 1787
    01:07
    which forbid slavery in the Old
    01:09
    Northwest so dr. Emerson is going to die
    01:13
    in the early 1840s and Scott will sue
    01:16
    for his freedom on his behalf and his
    01:19
    family's behalf eventually it makes its
    01:22
    way up to the Supreme Court which is
    01:23
    where the Supreme Court hopes to address
    01:26
    the issue of slavery once and for all
    01:28
    they actually thought they had a chance
    01:30
    to settle the issue of slavery boy will
    01:32
    they ever
    01:34
    all right so Supreme Court's decision
    01:35
    Chief Justice Roger B tani wrote the
    01:39
    majority opinion and stated the finally
    01:42
    there was Roger beat one
    01:45
    african-americans and it did not matter
    01:47
    if they were free or slave were not
    01:49
    citizens and could not sue the court so
    01:52
    immediately millions of African
    01:54
    Americans again whether they were free
    01:56
    or slaves were not citizens and were not
    02:00
    entitled to any of the rights that are
    02:02
    that citizens to huge ramifications
    02:06
    number two slaves were considered
    02:09
    property and therefore they could not be
    02:12
    taken away without due process the Fifth
    02:14
    Amendment says that individuals cannot
    02:16
    be deprived of life liberty or property
    02:19
    without due process
    02:20
    so not only are slaves not citizens they
    02:23
    are property this is a double blow to
    02:26
    African Americans and finally the
    02:30
    Missouri Compromise was deemed
    02:31
    unconstitutional now it was overturned
    02:33
    essentially with the kansas-nebraska Act
    02:35
    but it kind of reinforces that this is a
    02:38
    Congress could not regulate slavery in
    02:40
    territories and if we remember that
    02:42
    Missouri Compromise like it's just
    02:44
    thirty six thirty latitude line here and
    02:46
    the Louisiana Purchase so all this green
    02:49
    up here this Missouri Territory 1812
    02:52
    should have been free but according to
    02:57
    Roger B Taney the Supreme Court that was
    03:00
    unconstitutional so three significant
    03:02
    rulings as a part of the Dred Scott case
    03:06
    okay so let's talk about the impacting
    03:08
    really tensions will drastically
    03:10
    increase between the North and the South
    03:11
    many in the north are shocked at this
    03:13
    they could not believe what the Supreme
    03:15
    Court just did and many jump on the
    03:18
    abolitionist bandwagon if they were not
    03:20
    already on there Steven Douglas the
    03:23
    senator from Illinois is dead set
    03:24
    against this and and in his famous
    03:26
    Freeport doctrine speech he stated that
    03:29
    he believed territories could not
    03:31
    enforce the decision if they didn't
    03:32
    wanted to and this will split the
    03:34
    Democratic Party along sectional lines
    03:36
    guaranteeing in 1860 that a Democrat
    03:39
    will not win the presidential election
    03:40
    you want more info on the Freeport
    03:42
    doctrine check out the link in the
    03:44
    description which has a video on the
    03:46
    lincoln-douglas debates
    03:48
    and then for in order for
    03:49
    african-americans to become citizens a
    03:51
    new Supreme Court case or an amendment
    03:54
    would it be needed it's the only way you
    03:56
    can change your Supreme Court decision
    03:57
    and we'll see after this of war
    03:59
    thankfully the 14th amendment will come
    04:01
    along which granted citizenship to
    04:03
    that's looking all right that's
    04:06

    00:00
    hey what's going on a push peeps we have
    00:01
    one of the most important elections in
    00:03
    US history for you today this one is
    00:06
    specifically mentioned in the new apush
    00:08
    curriculum this one is the election of
    00:10
    1860 so be familiar with this it will be
    00:13
    on your test in some way shape or form I
    00:15
    can virtually guarantee you all right
    00:17
    let's do some background info on this
    00:19
    election James Buchanan who was the
    00:21
    incumbent or the sitting vice president
    00:23
    is not running for re-election and there
    00:26
    is mr. Buchanan down there the
    00:29
    Democratic Party was split along
    00:30
    sectional lines along the north and the
    00:32
    south
    00:33
    due to in part Douglass's Freeport
    00:36
    doctrine which he talked about in the
    00:38
    lincoln-douglas debates of 1858 which he
    00:40
    said if a territory won - where stay won
    00:43
    - they could essentially forbid slavery
    00:46
    even though the Supreme Court said that
    00:47
    could not happen if you want more info
    00:49
    check out my video on the
    00:51
    lincoln-douglas debates I have a link to
    00:53
    it in the description below John Brown's
    00:55
    raid at Harpers Ferry took place one
    00:57
    year before in 1859 and there is John
    01:00
    Brown he was put to death for his
    01:02
    involvement in the rate again I do have
    01:06
    a video on that as well
    01:08
    and many people in the South feared that
    01:10
    the Republicans in the North were
    01:12
    dominated by these John Brown loving
    01:15
    abolitionists so there's fear in the
    01:16
    South the north is going to eventually
    01:18
    eliminate slavery so all this is kind of
    01:20
    in the background as the election of
    01:23
    1860 approaches so let's get to the
    01:25
    candidates well for the Democratic
    01:27
    candidates there are actually two of
    01:29
    them the first one is this guy Stephen
    01:31
    Douglas we know him as an advocate of
    01:34
    popular sovereignty take a minute think
    01:35
    about what is popular sovereignty you
    01:37
    know what is it if you said it is
    01:40
    allowing the people in the territory to
    01:41
    vote on the issue of slavery you are
    01:43
    100% correct very nice job now in the
    01:46
    South they do not support Stephen
    01:47
    Douglas they turned on him after the
    01:49
    Freeport doctrine so they support the
    01:51
    sitting vice president John C
    01:54
    Breckinridge who was Buchanan's vice
    01:56
    president he is from Kentucky so there
    01:58
    are two Democrats running and you have
    02:00
    one Republican candidate this guy Abe
    02:02
    Lincoln now he is campaigning on a free
    02:05
    soil platform you need to understand
    02:07
    this please I beg you
    02:08
    he campaigned on the non extension of
    02:11
    slavery he did not
    02:12
    pain to get rid of slavery the
    02:13
    Republicans did not campaign on getting
    02:15
    rid of slavery rather they campaigned in
    02:18
    Lincoln campaign I'm not allowing
    02:20
    slavery to expand or spread it's a very
    02:24
    important distinction that you
    02:25
    absolutely positively have to know now
    02:27
    there's a fourth part of the
    02:28
    constitutional Union Party and this guy
    02:31
    is running John Bell and the whole
    02:33
    purpose of this was that they want to
    02:34
    preserve the Constitution and preserve
    02:36
    Union their platform was we're going to
    02:38
    abide by the Constitution so four main
    02:41
    players let's figure out what the issues
    02:44
    were there's really no getting around it
    02:46
    the number one issue is slavery no this
    02:48
    is such a big issue because you decant
    02:50
    that compromise of 1850 the
    02:52
    kansas-nebraska Act and the Dred Scott
    02:54
    decision all of those occurred within
    02:57
    the previous ten years of 1860 and they
    02:59
    all fail to reduce sectional tension so
    03:02
    you have again the north and the south
    03:03
    are really pitted against each other and
    03:05
    it's all over slavery
    03:07
    now many fire-eater southerners
    03:09
    threatened secession if Lincoln won
    03:12
    never called fire-eaters because they
    03:13
    just threatened to break away from the
    03:15
    country so the South many people in the
    03:17
    South made it known if a Republican wins
    03:19
    the election of 1860 they're bailing on
    03:21
    the Union they're bouncing on out of
    03:23
    this country so let's go to the results
    03:25
    in order to become president 152
    03:28
    electoral votes were needed at that time
    03:31
    Stephen Douglas only gets 12 he carries
    03:33
    one state Bell gets 39 he carries a
    03:36
    couple more Breckenridge gets 72 he
    03:39
    carries most of the south and Lincoln
    03:42
    gets 180 now let's take a look at this
    03:45
    map and you'll notice it says the
    03:46
    Lincoln wins the election without
    03:48
    carrying a single southern state and
    03:50
    that's very important to understand
    03:52
    because the population most the
    03:54
    population is located in the North look
    03:56
    at New York has 35 electoral votes
    03:58
    Pennsylvania's 27 I remember that is
    04:01
    determined by the number of Senators and
    04:03
    members of the House of Representatives
    04:05
    you'll notice that the North has more of
    04:07
    the population so wankin is able to win
    04:09
    and he wins without a single state
    04:13
    voting for him that owns slaves so all
    04:15
    the South's votes for other people but
    04:17
    the north votes were linked in the south
    04:19
    is essentially going to say we cannot be
    04:22
    in this country if somebody can win the
    04:24
    presidency without having a
    04:26
    single person from the south vote for
    04:27
    them alright let's talk about the impact
    04:30
    you have to know the impact it is the
    04:31
    immediate cause of the Civil War
    04:33
    southern states begin to secede before
    04:36
    Lincoln's inauguration on March 4th 1861
    04:38
    remember you used to be March 4th then
    04:40
    the 20th amendment changes that to
    04:42
    January 20th so South Carolina and
    04:45
    December 20th 1860 leaves a few weeks
    04:48
    later Mississippi leaves on January 9th
    04:50
    Florida the following day on the 10th
    04:52
    Alabama the day after that on the 11th
    04:54
    Georgia on the 19th of January Louisiana
    04:57
    on February 1st and all of this is
    05:00
    happening on Buchanan's watch so before
    05:01
    Lincoln even becomes president six
    05:04
    states seceded from the Union and
    05:06
    Buchanan did absolutely nothing to stop
    05:08
    the secession he didn't feel he had the
    05:10
    power to do anything so he essentially
    05:12
    just sat back and did nothing now more
    05:16
    states seceded after the war officially
    05:17
    started on April 12 1861 that's when the
    05:21
    first shots were fired for summer and
    05:23
    sadly that is Henry Clay's birthday the
    05:25
    man who loved the Union you know what is
    05:27
    he preserved the Civil War actually
    05:29
    started on his birthday how's that for
    05:30
    irony huh so Virginia
    05:32
    five days later succeeds and sides with
    05:35
    the south and Arkansas does as well on
    05:38
    May 6th and Tennessee does the next day
    05:41
    I'm a Sabbath and finally North Carolina
    05:43
    is the last southern state to secede on
    05:45
    May 20th though you'll notice all these
    05:47
    orange states these are the Confederate
    05:49
    States of America these are the southern
    05:51
    states during the war now we see these
    05:53
    yellow states here these are very
    05:54
    important we're going to talk about them
    05:55
    in the Civil War and I do have a video
    05:57
    on that check that out in the
    05:58
    description below these are called the
    06:00
    border states and they own slaves but
    06:02
    they were part of the North during the
    06:05
    Civil War they did not break away very
    06:07
    important to note because they are a
    06:08
    huge huge player in the Civil War all
    06:11
    right let's finish up with some test
    06:12
    tips for multiple choice and short
    06:14
    answer questions absolutely no way if
    06:16
    ands or buts about know that Lincoln's
    06:17
    platform was for the non extension of
    06:19
    slavery and also know that the election
    06:22
    was an immediate cause of secession and
    06:24
    the Civil War for essay questions you
    06:27
    could talk about the failures of
    06:28
    compromise that led failures of
    06:30
    compromises that led to the election of
    06:32
    1860 in the Civil War and you could even
    06:35
    see an essay question on you know

    big issue as a result of manifest
    00:37
    destiny in the 1840s and 1850s popular
    00:40
    sovereignty is the right for individuals
    00:42
    of a territory to vote on whether or not
    00:45
    that territory will be free or slave and
    00:47
    that was a huge cause of this of war
    00:49
    because fighting breaks out we have
    00:52
    states rights versus federal power and
    00:54
    that has been an issue since the
    00:55
    beginning of the Constitution ultimately
    00:57
    who has more power a very famous book
    01:00
    written by this woman Harriet Beecher
    01:01
    Stowe called Uncle Tom's Cabin was
    01:03
    published and really turned a lot of
    01:05
    people in the north to abolitionists I
    01:08
    don't know if you noticed or not she
    01:08
    lived in Cincinnati for a while so she
    01:11
    hails from that great city all right
    01:13
    some immediate causes that you should
    01:15
    know first and foremost it is the
    01:16
    election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 if
    01:19
    you take a look at this presidential map
    01:21
    from 1860 you'll see that and not a
    01:23
    single southern state did Lincoln win
    01:25
    and the electoral vote so the South
    01:27
    feels if if a person can become
    01:29
    president without winning a single
    01:30
    southern state why should we be in this
    01:33
    country and please keep in mind Lincoln
    01:36
    and the Republicans did not want to
    01:38
    fight the Civil War because of slavery
    01:40
    they fought it to preserve the Union and
    01:43
    that's in the beginning and will shift
    01:44
    and again Lincoln did not campaign on
    01:46
    abolishing slavery he campaigned on
    01:49
    keeping slavery from expanding and on
    01:53
    April 12 1861 what would have been Henry
    01:57
    Clay's 84th birthday had he still been
    01:59
    alive
    02:00
    is the attack on Fort Sumter in South
    02:03
    Carolina which officially begins the
    02:06
    Civil War
    02:07
    okay let's talk about some key terms
    02:08
    that you should know conscription is a
    02:10
    fancy word for saying draft or forced
    02:13
    and enforced enlistment now during the
    02:15
    Civil War substitutes could be hired for
    02:17
    people that were drafted so if you were
    02:19
    drafted and you were wealthy enough you
    02:21
    could pay for somebody else to go in
    02:23
    place and that is something that this
    02:24
    man here did Theodore Roosevelt senior
    02:28
    Teddy Roosevelt's father actually hired
    02:30
    a substitute for himself in the Civil
    02:32
    War and Teddy Roosevelt and admired his
    02:34
    father said that was the one thing that
    02:36
    his father did wrong his entire life we
    02:39
    see as a result of the draft that in New
    02:41
    York City there are draft rights that
    02:42
    happen in 1863 in which hundreds of
    02:44
    people were killed and this is involves
    02:47
    mostly Irish Americans and African
    02:50
    Americans and you'll hear a slogan
    02:53
    during this time begin to develop which
    02:54
    can be applied to lots of wars but
    02:56
    certainly this one which said that was a
    02:58
    rich man's war but a poor man's fight
    03:01
    all right contraband is another term
    03:03
    that you should know and these are
    03:04
    escaped slaves that crossed over into
    03:06
    the Union from the south and they worked
    03:08
    at camps and often fought in the war on
    03:11
    behalf of the Union
    03:13
    it finally copperheads those are
    03:15
    Democrats usually in the north that
    03:17
    spoke out against the war so they were
    03:19
    against going to war with south all
    03:22
    right some strategies and battles you
    03:24
    should be familiar with the Union
    03:25
    blockade of the South was a major thing
    03:28
    that the Union did in the beginning this
    03:31
    happened when Congress was not in
    03:32
    session so some people argued that Abe
    03:35
    Lincoln abused his power later on we
    03:37
    have something called the Anaconda plan
    03:39
    which was developed by General Winfield
    03:41
    Scott you see that this again is the
    03:43
    idea of a blockade and it kind of takes
    03:47
    a shape of a snake so if you follow the
    03:49
    snake around you'll see that it's
    03:50
    blackening all of the Atlantic Ocean in
    03:53
    the Gulf of Mexico and then it will come
    03:54
    up and cut down the Mississippi River
    03:56
    which would essentially cut the south
    03:58
    into so as a way to to economically hurt
    04:01
    the south during the war the Battle of
    04:03
    Antietam is one of the few battles that
    04:05
    you should be familiar with and this was
    04:07
    the bloodiest day of the war in the
    04:08
    south withdraws technically the Union
    04:11
    wins but they didn't really pursued this
    04:13
    out and this was important because this
    04:15
    was a turning point because it helped
    04:16
    persuade Europe to not intervene on
    04:18
    behalf of the south
    04:20
    for a while England and Britain were
    04:22
    wondering should they intervene on
    04:25
    behalf of the south and ultimately after
    04:27
    the Battle of Antietam they decide not
    04:29
    to and also this helps lead to the
    04:31
    issuance of the Emancipation
    04:32
    Proclamation which we'll talk about
    04:34
    right now so the Emancipation
    04:36
    Proclamation was issued at January 1st
    04:38
    1863 so this is a little less than 2
    04:41
    years of Lincoln being in office and
    04:43
    here is a very famous painting which
    04:45
    illustrates this and members of his
    04:47
    cabinet including this guy salmon P
    04:49
    chase who was his Secretary of Treasury
    04:51
    and was also from Cincinnati and when
    04:54
    the greatest Secretary of State's ever
    04:56
    William Seward right here alright and
    04:57
    this freed slaves only in areas of
    05:00
    rebellion so this did not free slaves
    05:03
    everywhere especially in the border
    05:05
    states will talk about the border states
    05:06
    in just a moment it only freed air
    05:09
    slaves in areas of rebellion or the
    05:11
    Confederate States of America which
    05:13
    ultimately Lincoln did not have power
    05:15
    over and also not in areas under Union
    05:18
    control so for example in New Orleans
    05:20
    which was under control the Union at
    05:21
    this time slaves were not freed in and
    05:25
    this helped change the goal or the goals
    05:27
    of the war remember in the beginning the
    05:29
    war was fought to preserve the Union
    05:30
    this is really the first step towards
    05:32
    abolishing slavery and this happens in
    05:34
    1863 alright so who where the border
    05:37
    states what were the border states well
    05:39
    they were slave states that did not
    05:40
    secede during the Civil War so if you
    05:42
    take a look at this map all the blue
    05:45
    states are free states all the orange
    05:48
    are Confederate states or states that
    05:51
    had slaves that seceded and then the
    05:52
    yellow here are border states you could
    05:54
    see there right between the border the
    05:56
    north and south and they had slaves but
    05:58
    did not secede and that included
    06:00
    Missouri Kentucky West Virginia which
    06:03
    comes a little later it's formed during
    06:05
    the Civil War and then we have Maryland
    06:06
    and Delaware as well and many people in
    06:10
    these states fought on behalf of the
    06:11
    Union even though they had slaves so
    06:14
    which states did these include again no
    06:16
    these five it's Missouri Kentucky
    06:17
    Maryland Delaware in West Virginia later
    06:20
    after it is formed from Virginia okay
    06:23
    the Gettysburg Address also happens in
    06:25
    1863 this is issued on November 19 1863
    06:28
    and Lincoln dedicated the battlefield as
    06:30
    a cemetery and he referenced the
    06:33
    Declaration
    06:34
    pendants in this address and he says
    06:36
    four score and seven years ago which say
    06:39
    it's 487 years ago or 87 years prior to
    06:42
    1863 which was 1776 and the conclusion
    06:46
    of this he says we here highly resolve
    06:48
    that these dead shall not have died in
    06:50
    vain that this nation under God shall
    06:52
    have a new birth of freedom and that the
    06:55
    government of the people by the people
    06:57
    for the people shall not perish from
    07:00
    Earth so you see here he's saying that
    07:03
    these people shall not have died in vain
    07:04
    err they should not have died for
    07:06
    nothing and that this nation shall have
    07:08
    a new birth of freedom so again he's
    07:10
    referencing this idea of abolishing
    07:12
    slave 1863 is an important year for that
    07:15
    between the Emancipation Proclamation
    07:16
    and the Gettysburg Address and here is
    07:19
    one of two only known pictures of Abe
    07:22
    Lincoln at the Gettysburg Address it's
    07:24
    like Where's Waldo see if you could find
    07:26
    him in here later I'll identify but take
    07:28
    a look see if he could point him out
    07:29
    look for a guy with the beard oh there's
    07:32
    a couple beards in there see if you can
    07:33
    find him all right let's talk about
    07:34
    African Americans in the war beginning
    07:36
    1862 African Americans could enlist in
    07:39
    the war and a very famous regiment was
    07:42
    the 54th regiment from Massachusetts and
    07:44
    they were African Americans who fought
    07:46
    in the Civil War if you've ever seen the
    07:48
    movie glory and it's based on that group
    07:50
    of individuals they fought in segregated
    07:53
    units they did not fight along with
    07:55
    other white soldiers although oftentimes
    07:57
    they were commanded by white leaders and
    07:59
    they offered em manual labor
    08:01
    like building and digging trenches and
    08:03
    doing other manual work as well and
    08:05
    unfortunately for African Americans
    08:07
    during most of the war they were paid
    08:08
    less than their white counterparts
    08:10
    soldier soldiers of equal rank okay
    08:14
    women in the war as men fought in the
    08:15
    war women's employment opportunities
    08:17
    increase and you see women increasingly
    08:20
    becoming teachers factory workers and
    08:22
    get involved in the nursing funeral this
    08:25
    is where women really begin to dominate
    08:27
    the nursing field we have the National
    08:29
    Women's Law League which was founded by
    08:32
    Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B
    08:33
    Anthony two advocates of women's rights
    08:36
    and they hope to abolish slavery and
    08:37
    gain female suffrage they did achieve
    08:41
    one of their goals but not both of them
    08:43
    Clara Barton this famous woman here
    08:45
    helped distribute medical supplies
    08:47
    during the
    08:48
    and later she founded the Red Cross
    08:51
    which assists those in need during times
    08:54
    of disaster and okay we'll talk about
    08:56
    personal liberties in the war keep in
    08:58
    mind whether it's a civil war really any
    09:00
    more personal liberties tend to go down
    09:02
    during Wars habeas corpus what this
    09:05
    means and this is Garrity in the
    09:07
    Constitution you cannot be held in jail
    09:09
    without having charges brought against
    09:11
    you so if you are arrested the
    09:13
    government needs to tell you what you
    09:14
    were arrested for and then get the
    09:15
    process going to have a trial well
    09:17
    during the Civil War Lincoln suspended
    09:20
    habeas corpus in Maryland so he would
    09:22
    have people held in jail without a trial
    09:25
    and this is something that only Congress
    09:27
    can suspend but he has an identity he
    09:29
    increased the power of the presidency in
    09:31
    1861 we have a court case ex parte
    09:34
    Merriman in which the court ruled the
    09:36
    president could not suspend habeas
    09:37
    corpus however Lincoln ignored the
    09:40
    decision and that was a decision that
    09:42
    was made by Chief Justice Roger B tani
    09:45
    he said to Lincoln wrong for suspending
    09:47
    habeas corpus you should not do that
    09:49
    you're not allowed to do that but
    09:51
    Lincoln ignored him and did it anyway
    09:53
    all right newspapers in Maryland were
    09:56
    shut down that were critical of
    09:57
    Lincoln's so he was harsh to those that
    10:00
    were critical of him or the war effort
    10:02
    all right we'll talk about the end of
    10:04
    the war and the effects of the war at
    10:06
    April 9th 1865 General Robert ely of the
    10:09
    south surrenders for all intents and
    10:11
    purposes the Civil War is over although
    10:13
    some fighting still does occur five days
    10:15
    later on April 14th Lincoln was shot and
    10:18
    that Vice President Johnson becomes
    10:20
    president and then we go through an era
    10:22
    known as reconstruction and a big
    10:24
    question about redirection is who will
    10:25
    be in charge will be the presidents or
    10:27
    will it be Congress and they do have a
    10:29
    video a reconstruction if you would like
    10:30
    to check in the description for the link
    10:32
    on that and we also have key
    10:34
    Reconstruction Amendments the 13th 14th
    10:36
    and 15th amendments alright that's
    10:39
    everything you need to know about the
    10:41
    Civil War for a push thank you very much
    10:42
    for watching follow the arrow and you
    10:44

    00:00
    hey what's up ap world video today for
    00:02
    you on reconstruction you know it will
    00:04
    be on your AP test in some way shape or
    00:07
    form it's actually been a while sensor
    00:09
    has been a free response or DBQ on
    00:11
    reconstruction so you never know may
    00:12
    appeared there but this video will cover
    00:14
    everything you need to know about
    00:15
    reconstruction for your apush exam ok
    00:18
    let's do a brief intro on what
    00:19
    reconstruction is and it is attempting
    00:21
    to achieve national unification after
    00:24
    the Civil War so it's basically trying
    00:25
    to reunite the country and get it back
    00:28
    as one key questions regarding
    00:31
    reconstruction is who would control
    00:32
    reconstruction this is a congressional
    00:34
    thing is as a presidential thing and how
    00:36
    would the self be treated would they be
    00:38
    treated nicely would they be treated
    00:39
    harshly somewhere between lots of
    00:41
    questions hopefully we'll be able to
    00:42
    answer these ok when this war ends
    00:45
    Lincoln dies about a week we can have
    00:47
    later and he has a plan for
    00:49
    reconstruction or how the south should
    00:51
    be readmitted and this plan was
    00:52
    considered very favorable to the south
    00:54
    this plan was called the 10% planning he
    00:57
    said if 10% of voters in the 1860
    00:59
    election southern voters pledged loyalty
    01:01
    to the US that state could be readmitted
    01:04
    and that 1860 year is very important
    01:06
    because that's the year Lincoln was
    01:08
    elected and when this southern state
    01:10
    started to secede Congress felt it was
    01:13
    too lenient so they kind of had a
    01:15
    different idea and this was seen in the
    01:17
    way Davis bill in Congress specifically
    01:19
    the Republicans sought 50% of the voters
    01:21
    in the 1860 election to pledge
    01:24
    allegiance instead of Lincoln's 10 and
    01:26
    they can actually pocket vetoes this so
    01:28
    the wait davis bill never happens but it
    01:30
    demonstrates the difference between
    01:31
    presidential and congressional views of
    01:34
    the readmission of southern states
    01:36
    President Johnson's a background on him
    01:38
    his reconstruction plan was similar to
    01:41
    Lincoln followed a 10% plane as well and
    01:43
    he also required States reluctantly
    01:45
    required States to ratify the 13th
    01:47
    amendment and Confederates could appeal
    01:49
    to him directly for a pardon or to be
    01:52
    forgiven for a crime he was disliked by
    01:54
    Radical Republicans because he was a
    01:56
    Democrat from the south
    01:58
    he was added to Lincoln's ticket in 1864
    02:01
    to kind of get a better balance and he
    02:03
    was impeached for violating the tenure
    02:05
    of office act which was an ex
    02:07
    pacifically set up to get him in trouble
    02:09
    ended up firing a holdover from
    02:12
    Lincoln's
    02:12
    ministration Secretary of War Stanton
    02:14
    who supported radical Republican ideas
    02:17
    so he was fired by Johnson and then
    02:19
    because he violated this Act which said
    02:21
    that the president cannot fire any
    02:24
    cabinet members without their approval
    02:25
    he was impeached and impeached means
    02:28
    charges were brought against you he was
    02:31
    not removed to Johnson fell one vote shy
    02:34
    of being removed and he was tried in the
    02:36
    Senate and Chief Justice salmon P chase
    02:39
    here was the judge in his trial he is
    02:42
    from Cincinnati in case you didn't know
    02:44
    okay so we have this term radical
    02:46
    reconstruction we've been talked about
    02:47
    why does this occur
    02:48
    well Congress and the Republicans wanted
    02:50
    to maintain their power and their two
    02:52
    key congressmen were going to focus on
    02:54
    Thaddeus Stevens over here and if you've
    02:56
    seen the movie Lincoln that is who Tommy
    02:58
    Lee Jones played and Charles Sumner over
    03:01
    here and if you remember he was one that
    03:03
    was beaten by the cane in the 1850s by
    03:07
    Preston Brooks former Confederate
    03:09
    officials ran for federal office we have
    03:11
    this guy Alexander Stephens who was the
    03:14
    vice president of the Confederate States
    03:15
    of America he became a senator in the US
    03:18
    so the North was furious the Radical
    03:20
    Republicans were furious wondering what
    03:22
    on earth did they fight the Civil War
    03:24
    for the South also instituted Black
    03:26
    Codes which regulated affairs of
    03:28
    freedmen or former slaves and conditions
    03:31
    were very similar to slavery so again
    03:33
    what was the war fought for if
    03:34
    conditions were going to be very similar
    03:36
    an important part of radical
    03:38
    reconstruction is that the South is
    03:40
    divided into five different military
    03:43
    zones you see one two three four five
    03:45
    here each one would be headed by a Union
    03:48
    General and this lasted for several
    03:50
    years as we will see okay the Freedmen's
    03:54
    Bureau the goal of this this was
    03:55
    established in 1866 and they want to
    03:57
    help former slaves survive and adjust to
    03:59
    their new life they also provided food
    04:01
    medicine and clothing to former slaves
    04:03
    and poor whites many people were
    04:06
    promised forty acres and a mule although
    04:09
    this rarely happened but the biggest
    04:11
    success you must know the biggest
    04:12
    success of the Freedmen's Bureau it was
    04:14
    not providing food was not providing
    04:17
    medicine it was not providing 40 acres
    04:18
    and a mule rather it was providing
    04:20
    education hundreds of thousands of
    04:22
    blacks were educated that's very
    04:24
    important because during the Civil War
    04:26
    to the Civil War it was illegal for for
    04:28
    blacks to learn how to read and write
    04:30
    and there were illiteracy rates were as
    04:32
    high as 90% for African American so the
    04:35
    Freedmen's Bureau helps address that
    04:37
    know that guys okay we're going to throw
    04:39
    three amendments at you in some key
    04:40
    terms thirteenth amendment bade slavery
    04:43
    illegal this was pushed by Lincoln if
    04:45
    you've seen the movie link and that's
    04:46
    what the entire movie is about
    04:47
    fourteenth amendment comes a little bit
    04:49
    later does a couple things one you must
    04:51
    know a granted citizenship to blacks and
    04:53
    also provided equal protection for
    04:56
    citizens that could not be denied and
    04:59
    the other thing it did was it made it so
    05:01
    that former Confederate officers could
    05:03
    not hold state or federal office this
    05:05
    was directed at for example Alexander
    05:07
    Stephens any high-ranking Confederate
    05:10
    officials could not hold a state or
    05:12
    federal office the 15th amendment which
    05:14
    comes a little bit later granted
    05:16
    suffrage for blacks and the South found
    05:18
    loopholes to get around this poll taxes
    05:20
    literacy test grandfather clauses etc so
    05:23
    these are key amendments that you
    05:25
    absolutely positively must know although
    05:26
    the Fifteenth Amendment the self found
    05:28
    ways to get around to other key terms
    05:31
    you need to know as a scalawag and
    05:32
    notice that scalawag starts with an S
    05:34
    and they were southerners s NS
    05:36
    southerners that favored reconstruction
    05:39
    carpetbaggers were those who lived in
    05:42
    the north and moved to the south during
    05:43
    reconstruction for a variety of reasons
    05:45
    some of which wanted to make money and
    05:47
    the force acts were passed in 1872 1871
    05:51
    these were passed in response to the Ku
    05:53
    Klux Klan which was terrorizing
    05:55
    african-americans and federal troops
    05:57
    could be scented and used to quell the
    05:59
    KKK very important slide guys please
    06:02
    make sure you know all of those terms
    06:04
    okay the end of Reconstruction why did
    06:06
    it ended it ends because of the
    06:08
    compromise of 1877 and this appears so
    06:11
    frequently in they push exam the
    06:13
    compromise settled the disputed 1876
    06:15
    presidential election between Ruth Furby
    06:19
    Hayes who is a Republican and Samuel
    06:21
    Tilden and Ruffner Furby Hayes becomes
    06:23
    president if you look at this map you'll
    06:26
    see that Hayes actually had fewer
    06:27
    popular votes than Tilden but he ends up
    06:31
    winning the electoral vote by one point
    06:33
    that's all that matters in this ended
    06:36
    military rule in this
    06:37
    as in capital letters because because it
    06:39
    is that important this officially ends
    06:42
    reconstruction in reconstruction marks
    06:45
    the end of the military occupation of
    06:47
    the south
    06:47
    also Hayes promised to have a southerner
    06:50
    appointed to his cabinet so what is the
    06:52
    impact of the end of Reconstruction Jim
    06:55
    Crow laws now come about which are which
    06:57
    makes segregation legal this is later
    07:00
    upheld in 1896 by the famous cork liked
    07:03
    by the famous court case Plessy vs.
    07:06
    Ferguson and also sadly for
    07:08
    african-americans we see
    07:09
    disenfranchisement many of them are not
    07:11
    voting or intimidated to not vote or
    07:14
    kept from voting because of poll taxes
    07:16
    and literacy tests as well okay that's
    07:18
    everything you need to know about
    07:19

    hey what's going on a push peeps we got
    00:02
    a good video for you today this one is
    00:03
    at reconstruction a very important time
    00:06
    period in US history lots of changes
    00:09
    occurred in the country during this time
    00:12
    before we begin a chat on time I want to
    00:14
    give shout outs to mrs. Barry's class at

    00:25
    watching I appreciate it
    00:27
    thank you for your support and good luck
    00:29
    in May alright well start off with what
    00:32
    is reconstruction it's attempting to
    00:34
    achieve national unification after the
    00:36
    Civil War so it is the literal and
    00:39
    figurative rebuilding of the United
    00:42
    States and a major question during this
    00:44
    time was who would control
    00:46
    reconstruction Congress with people like
    00:49
    that eeeh Stevens or the president
    00:51
    people like Andrew Johnson
    00:53
    so some Reconstruction Amendments you
    00:55
    must know no if ands or buts about it
    00:57
    some of the most important amendments in
    00:58
    our nation's history 13th abolish
    01:01
    slavery in here is the House of
    01:02
    Representative celebrating after it
    01:04
    passed the house 14th granted
    01:06
    citizenship and equal protection we'll
    01:08
    come back to that a lot throughout the
    01:09
    rest of this course and the 50th
    01:11
    amendment provided adult male suffrage
    01:14
    regardless of race or previous condition
    01:18
    of servitude so this was aimed at former
    01:20
    african-american male slaves what are
    01:24
    the impacts of the 14th and 15th
    01:25
    amendments well according to the
    01:26
    curriculum it states the women's rights
    01:28
    movement was both emboldened and divided
    01:31
    know that some women like Lucy Stone
    01:34
    argued for universal male suffrage first
    01:36
    with the hopes that female suffrage
    01:38
    would come after but others like
    01:40
    Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B
    01:42
    Anthony argued against the Fifteenth
    01:44
    Amendment because they wanted female
    01:46
    suffrage at the same time sadly for
    01:49
    women they would have to wait 50 years
    01:52
    to get the right to vote okay
    01:55
    presidential reconstruction this is from
    01:56
    1865 to 67 under people like Abe Lincoln
    02:00
    for a very short time and Johnson now
    02:03
    Lincoln's 10% plan was a plan that
    02:06
    called for southern states to be
    02:08
    remitted if 10% of voters in 1860
    02:11
    pledged loyalty 1860 is
    02:13
    in that Lincoln won the first time this
    02:17
    was very lenient at least according to
    02:19
    the eyes of many northerners and
    02:21
    Congress now Johnson had somewhat of a
    02:24
    similar plan and he wanted wealthy
    02:26
    plantation owners to ask for a pardon
    02:30
    from him radical reconstruction this is
    02:34
    what most people think of when they
    02:35
    think of reconstruction this is from
    02:36
    1867 to 1877 this is a response to
    02:40
    southerners actions such as Alexander
    02:43
    Stephens he was the vice president of
    02:45
    the Confederacy and he was actually
    02:47
    elected to be the senator from Georgia
    02:49
    so many in the North couldn't believe
    02:51
    that the second-in-command of the
    02:53
    Confederacy was back in the u.s. of
    02:55
    federal government also many southern
    02:58
    states passed Black Codes or harsh laws
    03:00
    that regulated the behavior of African
    03:02
    Americans it could actually be thrown in
    03:04
    jail for not having a job and many in
    03:07
    the North couldn't believe that the
    03:09
    South was trying to have the same social
    03:12
    structure that was in place prior to the
    03:14
    Civil War reconstruction Act of 1867
    03:17
    divided the south into five military
    03:19
    districts headed by this dude future
    03:22
    president ulysses s grant and again this
    03:24
    was the response to southerners such as
    03:26
    Alexander Stephens so the military is in
    03:29
    control of the south of federal
    03:31
    government during Reconstruction is
    03:33
    going to have an increased role okay who
    03:36
    were Radical Republicans well they
    03:37
    sought to change the balance of power
    03:38
    between Congress and the presidency and
    03:41
    reorder race relations in the south
    03:43
    that's straight from the curriculum they
    03:45
    impeached President Andrew Johnson but
    03:47
    the removal was one vote shy remember
    03:50
    peach does not mean removed from office
    03:52
    it simply means that charges are brought
    03:54
    against him many of Johnson's vetoes
    03:57
    were overridden by Congress including
    03:59
    the Civil Rights Act of 1866 which
    04:01
    guarantee protection for citizens all
    04:04
    citizens of the United States and
    04:06
    there's also reorder of race relations
    04:08
    several IFRIC African Americans held
    04:10
    political office such as this guy Hyrum
    04:13
    revels who was a senator from
    04:14
    Mississippi and african-american senator
    04:16
    during Reconstruction from Mississippi
    04:20
    okay some short-term successes of
    04:21
    reconstruction where's political and
    04:23
    leadership opportunities for former
    04:25
    slaves the Freedmen's Bureau
    04:27
    definitely know the start of this circle
    04:28
    underlined highlighted this provided
    04:30
    food medicine clothing in education to
    04:32
    former slaves its biggest success came
    04:34
    in education so my guys I want you to
    04:36
    circle the word education for me and
    04:38
    they promise forty acres in a meal but
    04:41
    this rarely rarely rarely happened most
    04:43
    often its biggest success came in
    04:45
    education but I want to look at this
    04:47
    political cartoon we see in the middle a
    04:50
    member from the Freedmen's Bureau
    04:51
    putting his hand up to a angry mob of
    04:55
    whites protecting African Americans
    04:58
    behind him so this visual represents the
    05:03
    government taking an increased role in
    05:05
    protecting African American rights
    05:08
    during Reconstruction okay moving on
    05:11
    over to land ownership and sharecropping
    05:13
    plantation owners still own a majority
    05:15
    of the land in the south and former
    05:17
    slaves had difficulty in acquiring lam
    05:19
    sharecropping emerge which allowed for
    05:22
    former slaves and poor whites to work on
    05:25
    farms and exchange land for an exchange
    05:27
    labor for land and housing and
    05:30
    oftentimes former slaves would work for
    05:33
    their former owners half of the crops
    05:35
    were given to the landowner as payment
    05:37
    and if cotton prices fell which they did
    05:39
    in the 1870s perpetual debt was common
    05:42
    for sharecroppers so this was a way to
    05:46
    tie african-americans and poor whites to
    05:50
    land so why did reconstruction fail well
    05:54
    according to the curricula says the
    05:56
    North's waning resolve you need to know
    05:58
    this word waning and I want you to write
    06:00
    it the way that I'm going to write it
    06:02
    here
    06:02
    waa N ing and notice it's getting
    06:06
    smaller it is decreasing so the north's
    06:09
    resolve or desire to keep up with
    06:12
    reconstruction is decreasing so by 1877
    06:16
    there are economic issues such as the
    06:18
    panic of 1873 and there are political
    06:20
    issues such as the election of 1876 and
    06:23
    this led many in the north to want to
    06:26
    move on from reconstruction we'll talk
    06:28
    about the election of 1876 that deals
    06:31
    with the compromise of 1877 so
    06:33
    Rutherford behaves as a Republican and I
    06:36
    have a video on this and he's running
    06:37
    for the presidency he there are three
    06:40
    states that have
    06:41
    Taurus boots that are in they have
    06:43
    electoral votes that are in dispute and
    06:45
    what happens is Congress decides to give
    06:47
    all of the electoral votes to Hayes and
    06:50
    he wins the election by one electoral
    06:53
    vote now he is a Republican from the
    06:55
    north now in return they promise to
    06:58
    withdraw the military from the south
    07:00
    those five military districts gone the
    07:02
    federal government that is down there
    07:04
    protecting African Americans gone that
    07:07
    is all gone from the south and notice
    07:10
    here that the south is voting
    07:11
    overwhelmingly democratic southern
    07:15
    resistance to reconstruction included
    07:16
    Jim Crow laws the KKK and black coats
    07:20
    which we'll talk about right now so four
    07:23
    major ways according to the curriculum
    07:24
    that the South resisted the 14th and
    07:27
    15th amendments this makes a great short
    07:29
    answer question or even an essay if you
    07:31
    ask me segregation is one way Jim Crow
    07:34
    laws allowed for inferior facilities for
    07:36
    african-americans and whites violence
    07:39
    was also used especially groups like the
    07:41
    KKK that performed lynchings not just on
    07:44
    African Americans but on supporters of
    07:46
    reconstruction but white supporters of
    07:49
    reconstruction in the south Supreme
    07:52
    Court decisions also upheld southern
    07:54
    resistance the civil rights cases from
    07:56
    1883 stated that individuals and private
    08:00
    businesses could discriminate against
    08:02
    minority groups and Plessy vs. Ferguson
    08:04
    from 1896 upheld the constitutionality
    08:07
    of Jim Crow laws stating that separate
    08:10
    but equal facilities were okay local
    08:13
    political tax tactics included poll
    08:15
    taxes where you had to pay to vote
    08:17
    literacy tests were you to take a test
    08:19
    of vote and whites could get around that
    08:21
    by the grandfather clause which would
    08:23
    allow them to be exempted from poll
    08:25
    taxes and literacy tests if their
    08:27
    grandfather or father could vote in the
    08:29
    election of 1860 remember in 1860
    08:32
    African Americans could not vote so they
    08:34
    would not be exempt from poll taxes and
    08:36
    literacy tests okay 14th and 15th
    08:38
    amendments in the 20th century we're
    08:40
    gonna head to the 1900s these amendments
    08:42
    will be used to uphold civil rights
    08:44
    especially when we see the Supreme Court
    08:46
    rule in Brown versus Board of Education
    08:48
    the separate-but-equal is not
    08:51
    constitutional finish up with some tests
    08:53
    tips from multiple choice and short
    08:55
    so remember the North's waning resolve I
    08:57
    can't stress enough you need to know the
    08:59
    word waning and the desire to change the
    09:01
    balance of power between Congress and
    09:03
    the president and also reorder race
    09:06
    relations methods used by the south to
    09:08
    resist 14th and 15th amendments
    09:10
    absolutely know that and for essays you
    09:12
    could see something about change in
    09:13
    continuity over time for
    09:14
    african-americans between say the years
    09:17
    1860 and 1877 and the effectiveness of
    09:20
    reconstruction thanks guys for watching

    00:43
    link below and I will try to get you in
    00:45
    a future video all right let's go over
    00:47
    some background info first they made the
    00:49
    patient proclamation issued during the
    00:52
    Civil War gave a moral cause to the
    00:54
    Civil War and Lincoln worried that it
    00:57
    would not be applicable post Civil War
    00:59
    he wanted something more permanent in
    01:02
    Republicans why don't you gain power in
    01:04
    the South post-civil warm one way they
    01:07
    can ensure that is by helping out
    01:09
    African Americans Radical Republicans
    01:11
    sought to punish former Confederate
    01:14
    leaders I do have a video reconstruction
    01:16
    you can check out if you want some more
    01:17
    background on reconstruction in Radical
    01:20
    Republicans as well so let's start off
    01:23
    talking about the Thirteenth Amendment
    01:24
    let's look at what the actual text says
    01:26
    says section one neither slavery nor
    01:29
    involuntary servitude except as a
    01:31
    punishment for crime whereof the party
    01:33
    shall have been duly convicted shall
    01:35
    exist within the United States or any
    01:38
    place subject to their jurisdiction
    01:41
    section 2 States Congress shall have the
    01:43
    power to enforce this article by
    01:45
    appropriate legislation so what exactly
    01:48
    does this amendment do will it abolish
    01:51
    slavery everywhere in the United States
    01:54
    and here is a visual that depicts the
    01:57
    scene in the House of Representatives
    01:59
    after it passed the House and the 100
    02:01
    States for ratification and this has
    02:04
    enormous Lee huge economic and social
    02:06
    implications for the country four
    02:08
    million African Americans are now free
    02:12
    let's
    02:13
    the Fourteenth Amendment what does this
    02:15
    say well sexual one says all persons
    02:16
    born or naturalized in the United States
    02:19
    and subject to the jurisdiction thereof
    02:22
    are citizens of the United States and of
    02:24
    the State wherein they reside no State
    02:27
    shall make or enforce any law which
    02:29
    shall abridge or shorten or take away
    02:32
    the privileges or immunities of citizens
    02:35
    of the United States nor shall any state
    02:37
    deprive any person of life liberty or
    02:40
    property without due process of law nor
    02:43
    deny to any person within its
    02:45
    jurisdiction the equal protection of the
    02:47
    laws this is such an enormous leap
    02:50
    ornament jump down to section 3 no
    02:53
    person shall be a senator or
    02:55
    representative in Congress or lector of
    02:58
    president and vice president or hold any
    03:00
    office civil or military under the
    03:03
    United States or under any state who
    03:05
    having previously taken an oath as a
    03:07
    member of Congress or as an officer of
    03:09
    the United States or as a member of any
    03:11
    state legislature or as an executive or
    03:14
    judicial officer of any state to support
    03:17
    the Constitution of the United States
    03:18
    shall have engaged in insurrection or
    03:21
    rebellion against the same or give an
    03:23
    aid or comfort to the enemies thereof
    03:26
    but Congress may by a vote of two-thirds
    03:28
    of each house remove such disability so
    03:33
    what the heck did list it do a lot of
    03:34
    words I just read well section one if
    03:36
    you're born in the United States you're
    03:38
    a US citizen and this overturned the
    03:40
    Dred Scott decision from 1857 they'd
    03:44
    also promoted equal protection of laws
    03:47
    however that was used very infrequently
    03:50
    at the time and more frequently in the
    03:52
    future which we'll see in just a few
    03:53
    moments section three this was
    03:55
    specifically aimed at people like
    03:56
    Alexander Stevens who was the vice
    03:58
    president of the Confederate States of
    04:00
    America it stated that Confederate
    04:02
    officials could not hold the u.s. office
    04:06
    all right let's go to the Fifteenth
    04:08
    Amendment what does it say well section
    04:10
    1 the right of the citizens of the
    04:12
    United States to vote shall not be
    04:13
    denied or abridged again you see the
    04:15
    word abridge be familiar with it by the
    04:17
    United States or by any State on account
    04:20
    of race color or previous condition of
    04:23
    servitude section 2 the Congress shall
    04:26
    have
    04:26
    power to enforce this article by
    04:28
    appropriate legislation let's take a
    04:31
    look at what this actually does it
    04:33
    provided suffrage for african-american
    04:35
    males and let's take a look at this very
    04:37
    famous painting that you should be
    04:38
    familiar with we see African American
    04:40
    males lined up to voting you can see
    04:43
    this guy back here who used to be in the
    04:45
    military so the 15th amendment provided
    04:47
    suffrage or the ability to vote for
    04:49
    African American males
    04:51
    what group do you notice is not included
    04:53
    in the Fifteenth Amendment notice it
    04:55
    does not say the right to vote shall not
    04:58
    be denied based on sex so that's very
    05:01
    important so this help provide for a
    05:04
    large Republican support from blacks in
    05:06
    the south so let's get to the impacts of
    05:09
    the amendments well let's focus on the
    05:11
    women's rights movement now the 14th and
    05:13
    15th amendments divided the group if you
    05:15
    remember prior to the Civil War during
    05:18
    the Civil War the women's rights
    05:19
    movement was staunchly abolitionist and
    05:21
    people like Frederick Douglass and
    05:23
    others favored black suffrage prior to
    05:27
    women's suffrage and Lucy Stone and
    05:29
    American women suffrage association hope
    05:32
    to achieve suffrage after reconstruction
    05:34
    Elizabeth Cady Stanton and people like
    05:37
    her feared that suffrage was not likely
    05:39
    near in the National Women's Suffrage
    05:41
    Association advocated an amendment for
    05:44
    women's suffrage and sadly for them that
    05:46
    does not come until the 19th amendment
    05:48
    in 1920 so the 14th and 15th amendment
    05:51
    absolutely positively no this it divided
    05:54
    the women's rights movement now
    05:58
    unfortunately southern states found ways
    06:01
    to get around these amendments they
    06:02
    enforced segregation and they also use
    06:05
    violence the KKK the Ku Klux Klan which
    06:08
    was a terrorist organization would
    06:10
    intimidate many southern blacks and
    06:11
    discouraged voting and they would Lynch
    06:13
    or publicly hang individuals who were
    06:16
    known to vote the Supreme Court also
    06:18
    encouraged southern states to find ways
    06:21
    to get around this and the civil rights
    06:22
    cases from 1883 this stated that
    06:25
    Congress could not prohibit
    06:26
    discrimination by private businesses and
    06:29
    individuals so if you owned your own
    06:31
    business you could still discriminate
    06:32
    against an individual and the landmark
    06:35
    Supreme Court case Plessy vs. Ferguson I
    06:37
    do have a video on that the Supreme
    06:39
    Court upheld
    06:40
    separate but equal facilities so this
    06:42
    allowed for discrimination as long as
    06:45
    facilities were quote-unquote equal
    06:47
    which they hardly ever work local
    06:51
    political tactics were also used to pull
    06:53
    taxes literacy tests and grandfather
    06:55
    clauses poll taxes were used by states
    06:57
    that force individuals to pay in order
    07:00
    to vote and that was used to
    07:01
    discriminate against African Americans
    07:03
    and literacy tests were also used which
    07:06
    would require an individual to pass a
    07:09
    test to vote now eventually these
    07:11
    amendments were used in court decisions
    07:13
    that upheld civil rights so even though
    07:15
    in the short term civil rights were not
    07:17
    upheld in the long term they weren't
    07:20
    will see that in 1954 with Brown versus
    07:23
    the Board of Education and other court
    07:25
    cases of the 1960s under the Warren
    07:28
    Court so named for Chief Justice Earl
    07:30
    Warren so let me stress this again even
    07:32
    though in the short term these
    07:34
    amendments did not protect individuals
    07:36
    they did lay their short term no long
    07:38
    term me a short term no long term yes
    07:41
    short term no okay let's go over some
    07:44
    test steps for multiple choice and short
    07:45
    answer questions be able to identify and
    07:48
    explain ways that states got around the
    07:50
    14th and 15th amendments and what was
    07:52
    the impact of the 14th amendment on
    07:54
    women's rights groups for essay
    07:55
    questions be able to compare the
    07:57
    effectiveness of amendments over time so
    08:00
    something like how the civil rights era
    08:02
    the nineteen fifties and sixties
    08:03
    completed their goals of the
    08:05
    Reconstruction Amendments alright guys
    08:07
    that is everything you need to know

    huge huge shout out to mrs. sours class

    of Ohio I appreciate you guys very much
    00:27
    for watching and best of luck in May
    00:30
    alright let's take a look at key
    00:31
    concepts 6.1 it states technological
    00:34
    advances large-scale production methods
    00:36
    in the opening of new markets encourage
    00:39
    the rise of industrial capitalism in the
    00:41
    United States so big idea questions to
    00:44
    focus on what was a relationship between
    00:46
    businesses and government and what ways
    00:50
    that the South change and remain the
    00:52
    same during this time and that will
    00:54
    focus on the historical thinking skills
    00:56
    of changing continuity over time you
    00:58
    could see an essay question on changing
    01:01
    continuity and finally how did farmers
    01:03
    and industrial workers respond to
    01:06
    corporations each will have different
    01:08
    takes and different reactions to
    01:10
    corporations
    01:11
    alright Roman number one states
    01:13
    large-scale industrial production
    01:15
    accompanied by massive technological
    01:17
    change expanding international
    01:19
    communication networks and pro-growth
    01:21
    government policies generated rapid
    01:24
    economic development and business
    01:26
    consolidation we need to figure out how
    01:28
    we're new markets open in North America
    01:30
    after the Civil War what we have the
    01:34
    government playing a large role in this
    01:35
    by providing money and land for the
    01:38
    construction of railroads and an example
    01:41
    of this is the Pacific Railway X which
    01:45
    gave subsidies government subsidies
    01:48
    which is money and land to the Pacific
    01:50
    Railway Company and we see here in 1869
    01:54
    the finishing of the Transcontinental
    01:56
    Railroad where the two tracks converged
    01:59
    as one and also telegraph lines were
    02:02
    often linked with railroads so where
    02:04
    railroad tracks went telegraph lines did
    02:07
    as well so what were the impacts of
    02:09
    these subsidies while we see the growth
    02:11
    of farms cities and a
    02:13
    lumber industry so the railroads are
    02:15
    really going to connect cities and farms
    02:17
    and make them more dependent on each
    02:19
    other so businesses increased the
    02:22
    production of goods during this time and
    02:24
    they did so in several different ways we
    02:25
    have technological advances a very
    02:27
    important term you should be familiar
    02:28
    with this Taylorism this was introduced
    02:31
    by this guy Frederick Taylor that
    02:32
    focused on improving efficiency workers
    02:34
    would have time tasks and they would
    02:37
    have specific tasks as well to do in a
    02:39
    certain amount of time wealth of greater
    02:41
    access to natural resources specifically
    02:44
    lumber as I mentioned on the previous
    02:45
    slide we have redesigned financial and
    02:48
    management structures now what that
    02:49
    means are things are emerging like
    02:51
    monopolies in which business is sought
    02:53
    to have sole control over in industry so
    02:57
    for example Rockefeller with rockefeller
    02:59
    oil will eventually gain is control as
    03:02
    much as 90% of the oil industry in
    03:04
    America we have marketing advances and
    03:07
    merging during this time with mail-order
    03:09
    catalogs places like Sears and
    03:11
    Montgomery Ward these department stores
    03:13
    they appeal to middle-class families and
    03:15
    would have these mail-order catalogs
    03:17
    that could reach farmers now in rural
    03:19
    areas and a growing labor force as well
    03:22
    with a large supply of workers so all of
    03:25
    those were factors that led to increased
    03:28
    production of goods during the late 19th
    03:32
    century so what was the impact of this
    03:33
    Industrial Revolution well with the
    03:35
    price of goods decreasing because they
    03:37
    become more efficiently produced and
    03:39
    workers wages increase the workers are
    03:42
    making more money new goods and services
    03:44
    emerged things like sewing machines
    03:46
    sporting equipment and other household
    03:48
    items become more popular and introduced
    03:50
    and the American standards of living
    03:52
    improved as a whole however there was a
    03:55
    gap that grew between the rich and the
    03:58
    poor so overall Americans are more
    04:01
    prosperous but there is a growing gap
    04:03
    between the rich and the poor business
    04:06
    leaders sought to increase profits by
    04:08
    consolidating businesses into the
    04:10
    following things you should be very
    04:11
    familiar with trusts which are
    04:13
    associated with monopolies trying to
    04:15
    gain control of an entire industry and
    04:17
    holding companies in which one company
    04:19
    would own stock and several other
    04:22
    companies thus allowing them to control
    04:25
    all of these companies
    04:27
    businesses and policy maker soft markets
    04:29
    and resources not only in the US but in
    04:32
    other areas as well for example in
    04:33
    Pacific Rim we have in Hawaii calls for
    04:36
    annexation in the 1890s because the
    04:38
    Hawaii was a huge producer of sugar and
    04:41
    it will eventually be annexed by the
    04:42
    United States also in Asia the
    04:45
    Philippines will be gained by the United
    04:47
    States in 1898 in which period six ends
    04:50
    and this is as a result of the
    04:52
    spanish-american war and in 1899 I
    04:55
    realized this is periods have been but
    04:56
    still the late 19th century with open
    04:58
    door policy in China in which the US
    05:00
    ought to trade freely with China and in
    05:02
    Latin America with a Big Brother policy
    05:04
    by Secretary of State James G Blaine and
    05:07
    this helped open up markets to the
    05:09
    United States so the u.s. is not only
    05:12
    focusing on domestic markets but
    05:15
    international markets as well let's take
    05:17
    a look at Roman numeral to a variety of
    05:20
    perspectives on the economy and labor
    05:21
    developed during a time of financial
    05:23
    panics and downturns laissez-faire this
    05:27
    is a very important term which
    05:28
    essentially the government takes its
    05:29
    hands off the economy now this became a
    05:31
    dominant economic philosophy this
    05:34
    encouraged very little government
    05:36
    regulation of industries and businesses
    05:38
    really favored this because the
    05:39
    government would not regulate what they
    05:42
    can and cannot do we also the expansion
    05:44
    of the industrial workforce due to
    05:46
    internal migration so domestically we
    05:49
    have farmers moving to cities the work
    05:51
    in factories and we also have this
    05:53
    enormous international migration or new
    05:56
    immigration and this is predominantly
    05:58
    made up of people from Southern and
    06:00
    Eastern Europe contrast that with old
    06:02
    immigration which is made up of people
    06:04
    from northern and western Europe and we
    06:07
    have people from China as well during
    06:09
    this time settling on the west coast
    06:11
    child labor would also increase because
    06:14
    fit many families relied on children for
    06:16
    wages and this huge supply of workers
    06:20
    led to lower wages for workers working
    06:23
    in factories issues such as labor versus
    06:27
    management emerge and they would battle
    06:29
    over wages and working conditions
    06:30
    especially in factories so local and
    06:34
    national unions would emerge to confront
    06:36
    businesses we have major Union the
    06:38
    Knights of Labor led by Terrance
    06:40
    Powderly who may have the thickest most
    06:43
    luscious mustache in US history look at
    06:46
    that monster and this was composed of
    06:48
    skilled and unskilled workers you need
    06:51
    to know the characteristics of this
    06:53
    labor union it was also made up of women
    06:55
    and african-americans now their downfall
    06:58
    came with a Haymarket Square riot in
    07:01
    Chicago in which this was a large
    07:04
    demonstration and Antar kissers in which
    07:06
    anarchists were there as well and
    07:08
    somebody nobody really knows who throws
    07:10
    a stick of dynamite killing and injuring
    07:12
    several people including police officers
    07:15
    now the Knights of Labor had nothing to
    07:17
    do with the explosion but they were
    07:20
    lumped in with a Haymarket Square right
    07:22
    so they did not last very long I do have
    07:24
    a video in unions you could check out
    07:26
    the description with much more detail
    07:27
    after them emerges the American
    07:30
    Federation of Labor or the AFL led by
    07:32
    Samuel Gompers and this was made up of
    07:34
    skilled workers only and it excluded
    07:37
    women and they focused on things called
    07:39
    bread-and-butter issues they wanted they
    07:42
    wanted 8 hour work days higher pay and
    07:45
    better conditions and they rarely used
    07:47
    strengths and unions as a whole hope to
    07:49
    improve working conditions and wages for
    07:53
    workers the south begins to dust
    07:56
    realized during this time it becomes
    07:59
    known as the new south in this term
    08:03
    called for increased industrialization
    08:05
    in the south and you see textile
    08:07
    factories began to appear in the south
    08:09
    so these factories that were so
    08:11
    dominating the north prior to the Civil
    08:13
    War in antebellum America are now
    08:15
    actually going to the source of the raw
    08:17
    materials in the south and a leader of
    08:19
    who called for the new south was Henry
    08:22
    Grady and editor of the Atlanta
    08:24
    Constitution so people are saying hey
    08:25
    the south should industrialize as well
    08:28
    and they do during this time however
    08:30
    sharecropping and tenant farming
    08:32
    remained throughout much of the south
    08:35
    and this is when people would rent land
    08:37
    and the payment land would be in the
    08:39
    form of cash if you're a tenant farmer
    08:41
    or in crops if you are a sharecropper
    08:44
    and many African Americans were
    08:46
    sharecroppers throughout the 1800s
    08:48
    continuing with key concepts six point
    08:50
    one Roman numeral three states new
    08:52
    systems of production and
    08:53
    transportation enabled consolidation
    08:55
    within agriculture which along with
    08:57
    periods of instability spurred a variety
    08:59
    of responses from farmers so we have an
    09:02
    increase in agricultural production
    09:04
    mechanized tractors Reapers etc they
    09:06
    allowed for less reliance and animals
    09:09
    and allowed for faster cultivation of
    09:11
    crops they were steam powered and then
    09:13
    eventually gas-powered grain elevators
    09:16
    were used to store crops and
    09:18
    transporting two railroads more easily
    09:21
    and this is a grain elevator from my
    09:23
    home city of Buffalo and you see here
    09:26
    would be right on the water so ships
    09:28
    could come in they would store the grain
    09:29
    here and then it would connect with a
    09:32
    railroad and ship to other parts of the
    09:34
    country or they and they would ship to
    09:37
    other parts of the country now the
    09:39
    increased production of goods led to a
    09:41
    decrease in food prices because the food
    09:44
    is being produced so quickly and so
    09:46
    efficiently prices will go down hurting
    09:49
    farmers so how did farmers respond to
    09:52
    consolidation of businesses and
    09:54
    railroads or how did they respond to
    09:56
    their plight
    09:56
    they created local and regional
    09:57
    cooperative organizations essentially
    10:00
    their own versions of unions we have the
    10:02
    Grange in the 1860s they sought to bring
    10:04
    farmers together to share techniques and
    10:05
    they hope to elect state legislators
    10:08
    that were that were favorable to their
    10:10
    programs Granger of laws were different
    10:12
    state laws that regulated railroads and
    10:15
    these were successful only for a limited
    10:16
    time because railroads fell under
    10:18
    interstate commerce which only Congress
    10:21
    could control the southern farmers
    10:23
    Alliance was mostly local organization
    10:25
    and they established stores and banks
    10:27
    for farmers and they excluded blacks so
    10:29
    that led to the colored farmers Alliance
    10:32
    which was mostly in the southern United
    10:34
    States and that was established to help
    10:36
    black farmers in the south so the people
    10:39
    or the populist party wicked what can
    10:42
    important Oh make sure you pay super
    10:44
    close attention to this this is it been
    10:47
    a very popular topic on past AP exams so
    10:50
    they this party called for a stronger
    10:52
    government role in the economic system
    10:54
    so what were the causes of the populist
    10:57
    party well they you have growth of
    10:58
    corporate power and railroads would
    11:00
    charge high rates that hurt farmers so
    11:02
    the People's Party the populist party is
    11:05
    really going to be made up of farmers
    11:07
    there's also economic instability that's
    11:09
    a cause to panics of 1873 in 1893 hurt
    11:12
    farmers and their goals they wanted to
    11:14
    stronger government role in the economic
    11:16
    system so they're kind of anti laissez
    11:18
    faire here and they also want a
    11:19
    graduated income tax which means the
    11:22
    more money you make the more you pay in
    11:24
    taxes they wanted the inflation of
    11:26
    currency which had helped poor farmers
    11:27
    and free silver not using just gold to
    11:31
    back up the value of money and the
    11:33
    Canada in 1896 was this dude William
    11:36
    Jennings Bryan who was a three-time
    11:38
    presidential candidate he also in 1896
    11:41
    ran as a Democrat and he advocated free
    11:44
    silver and four political reforms they
    11:49
    want the direct election of senators and
    11:51
    that will come true with the 17th
    11:52
    amendment at a later time period in
    11:54
    government ownership of railroads
    11:56
    telephones and Telegraph's because they
    11:57
    felt the companies were abusing their
    11:59
    power alright let's go over some test
    12:03
    tips for multiple choice and short
    12:04
    answer definitely know the new business
    12:05
    structures and their effects the role of
    12:08
    government during this time in the
    12:09
    plight of farmers focus on the populist
    12:13
    party and goals of labor unions
    12:15
    sharecropping as well make sure you know
    12:17
    what that is and the populist party holy
    12:20
    cow I can't stress that enough for
    12:22
    essays you could see an essay comparing
    12:24
    the role of government during this time
    12:26
    to other time periods and ways farmers
    12:29
    and laborers responded to corporations
    12:31
    during this time all right guys look

    00:36
    at key concepts 6.2 it states the
    00:38
    migrations that accompanied
    00:39
    industrialization transform both urban
    00:41
    and rural areas of the United States
    00:43
    it caused dramatic social and cultural
    00:46
    challenges so big idea questions you
    00:48
    should be able to answer by the end of
    00:49
    this video are why we're individuals
    00:51
    attracted to a city to cities and what
    00:54
    opportunities were there in cities how
    00:56
    did the federal government encourage
    00:58
    westward expansion and what were the
    01:00
    impacts of this expansion on natives and
    01:02
    how did immigrants adapt to life in
    01:04
    America alright let's take a look at
    01:07
    Roman numeral one it states
    01:08
    international and internal migration
    01:10
    increased urban populations and fostered
    01:13
    that word fostered means to encourage
    01:15
    the growth of a new urban culture so
    01:19
    cities see tremendous growth in the late
    01:21
    19th century and it's because that's
    01:24
    where factories and businesses are
    01:26
    located we have international migrants
    01:28
    coming to America and suddenly
    01:30
    predominantly in cities immigrants from
    01:32
    Asia especially China they're settling
    01:34
    on the west coast and Chinese immigrants
    01:37
    tended to work on railroads immigrants
    01:39
    from Europe are coming predominantly
    01:41
    from Southern and Eastern Europe during
    01:42
    this time and they are known as new
    01:43
    immigrants they're coming from places
    01:45
    like Italy Poland and Russia and there
    01:48
    were over 10 million new immigrants
    01:50
    between 1860 and 1890 now we're talking
    01:53
    about internal migrants these are people
    01:55
    within the United States that are moving
    01:57
    African Americans are moving within the
    01:59
    south and out of the south and many of
    02:01
    them are moving out of the south to
    02:03
    escape sharecropping and obtain better
    02:06
    economic opportunities so when we're
    02:08
    talking about migrants people moving why
    02:11
    are they moving to cities whether
    02:12
    they're move
    02:13
    internally in the United States or
    02:15
    internationally to the United States
    02:17
    they're moving to escape poverty again
    02:19
    the idea of the internal migrants from
    02:21
    the South moving to escape sharecropping
    02:23
    you have religious persecution is
    02:25
    another reason why international
    02:26
    migrants are moving Jews and Russia for
    02:29
    instance they are fleeing to the United
    02:30
    States because they're being persecuted
    02:32
    in many areas of Europe there's limited
    02:34
    opportunities opportunities for social
    02:36
    mobility and in the United States you
    02:38
    have this idea of rags to riches stories
    02:41
    which were made very popular by Horatio
    02:43
    Alger he was an author that wrote about
    02:45
    people who could be born poor and then
    02:47
    grew up and become rich and this was a
    02:50
    very popular idea that really was
    02:52
    pervasive all throughout the United
    02:54
    States in the late 19th century so let's
    02:57
    talk about the emergence of
    02:58
    neighborhoods in cities and these would
    03:01
    be based on ethnicity race and class for
    03:04
    instance you see places like Little
    03:06
    Italy or here Chinatown in San Francisco
    03:08
    develop and you would see that
    03:10
    immigrants would live near each other in
    03:12
    little enclaves they would provide new
    03:15
    cultural opportunities for these
    03:17
    immigrants with immigration comes
    03:19
    debates over assimilation that was a
    03:21
    result of this international migration
    03:24
    so we see a rise of nativism again not
    03:26
    the first time in US history with the
    03:28
    American Protective Association or the
    03:30
    APA they sought to limit immigrants and
    03:32
    keep Catholics from holding office
    03:33
    you've encountered this idea before you
    03:35
    remember from period 5 what political
    03:38
    party was formed to keep immigrants from
    03:40
    holding political power you know a
    03:42
    little genius
    03:43
    it is the know-nothing party of the
    03:45
    1840s and 1850s now JFK was not alive
    03:48
    during the time of the APA in the late
    03:50
    nineteen nineteenth century but if he
    03:53
    was he probably would have said
    03:54
    something like APA why are you hating on
    03:56
    Catholics Bros and he's saying that
    03:58
    because he was Catholic immigrants often
    04:02
    compromise between their own cultures
    04:04
    and u.s. culture and we see that
    04:06
    second-generation immigrants they were
    04:09
    more likely to assimilate than
    04:11
    first-generation or the children of
    04:13
    immigrants were more likely to assembly
    04:15
    and we see in many public schools in the
    04:17
    United States they really only taught
    04:19
    English so that was another way to
    04:21
    assimilate immigrants political machines
    04:23
    begin to develop in large cities and
    04:25
    these would provide job
    04:27
    and services for constituents and that's
    04:29
    a fancy word for voters and they would
    04:31
    provide these especially for immigrants
    04:33
    and the poor and we see this in Tammany
    04:35
    Hall with this dude boss tweet and in
    04:37
    return these immigrants are poor were
    04:39
    expected to vote for these politicians I
    04:42
    have a detailed video on political
    04:44
    machines in the description make sure
    04:45
    you check it out
    04:47
    now also during this time you see the
    04:48
    emergence of a distinctive middle class
    04:50
    this was caused by new managerial
    04:52
    workers and factories and clerical
    04:53
    workers so we see brand new jobs that
    04:55
    are opening up that are available to
    04:57
    both males and females increased
    04:59
    education opportunities many more
    05:01
    colleges are developing and consumer
    05:03
    culture will grow during this time your
    05:06
    baseball is becomes very popular and
    05:08
    here is a picture of the very first
    05:10
    baseball team the Cincinnati Red
    05:12
    Stockings that's right the Cincinnati
    05:14
    Reds were the first professional
    05:15
    baseball team we also have vaudeville
    05:18
    shows which were very which was a very
    05:20
    popular form of entertainment in cities
    05:23
    all right let's jump over two key
    05:25
    concepts 6.2 Roman numeral 2 large
    05:27
    numbers of migrants moved to the West in
    05:29
    search of land and Economic Opportunity
    05:30
    frequently provoking competition and
    05:33
    violent conflict so what were some
    05:35
    reasons for westward growth while we had
    05:37
    the Transcontinental Railroad that was
    05:39
    completed in 1869 built predominantly by
    05:42
    the Irish on the East Coast and as we
    05:44
    know the Chinese on the west coast we
    05:46
    also have the discovery of mineral
    05:47
    resources specifically minds like
    05:49
    Comstock Lode this entire town was was
    05:52
    created around mining government
    05:55
    policies such as the Homestead Act and
    05:57
    subsidies the railroad companies
    05:58
    encouraged westward growth and I would
    06:00
    definitely be familiar with these
    06:02
    different reasons I could see this as a
    06:03
    multiple choice question or even a short
    06:05
    answer question about reasons for
    06:08
    westward growth ok migrants moved to
    06:11
    rural and boomtown areas of the West and
    06:14
    the reason why while they're seeking
    06:16
    independence and self-sufficiency this
    06:18
    idea of the safety valve theory that no
    06:20
    matter what no matter how bad economic
    06:22
    times are you can always pick up your
    06:24
    bags and move out west what were some
    06:27
    opportunities available was well
    06:28
    building railroads as I've mentioned
    06:30
    mining farming and ranching as well
    06:32
    people like Teddy Roosevelt in the 1880s
    06:34
    pack up their bags move out west to try
    06:36
    to make money in ranching so what were
    06:39
    the impacts of this westward
    06:40
    migrations while we see the decimation
    06:42
    of the bison or Buffalo they almost
    06:46
    become extinct by the way what did that
    06:47
    Buffalo say to his son before he went
    06:50
    off to college bye son did you get it
    06:54
    think about it you'll get it and we have
    06:56
    conflict with natives and Mexican
    06:58
    Americans over land such as the sin
    07:00
    Creek massacre in 1864 in which 133
    07:03
    natives were killed mostly women and
    07:04
    children and another example would be
    07:06
    Custer's last stand or the Battle of
    07:09
    Little Bighorn so the US government
    07:12
    relations with natives I would
    07:14
    absolutely know this very very important
    07:16
    big idea and it has been a long long
    07:18
    time since aap is asked an essay
    07:21
    question about this time well the u.s.
    07:23
    often violated treaties with the natives
    07:25
    and they would use military force and
    07:27
    examples 1890 Wounded Knee in which 300
    07:30
    natives were killed again sadly mostly
    07:32
    women and children natives were moved to
    07:35
    reservations where they would lose their
    07:36
    sovereignty or their ability to rule
    07:38
    themselves now in spite of all this
    07:40
    natives tried to preserve their culture
    07:41
    in the face of assimilation policies and
    07:44
    we're going to figure out how first we
    07:46
    have to know what assimilation is an
    07:48
    example of this is the Dawes Act this is
    07:51
    trying to get Native Americans to act or
    07:53
    become American and one way this
    07:55
    happened was by sending Native children
    07:57
    to boarding schools and requiring these
    07:59
    children to only speak English native
    08:01
    families were given individual plots of
    08:03
    land where they were expected to farm as
    08:06
    opposed to hunting that they were used
    08:08
    to a way to try to preserve autonomy or
    08:11
    or their own culture is the Ghost Dance
    08:13
    and this was a ceremony in which natives
    08:15
    envisioned the return of Buffalo and the
    08:17
    elimination of whites and this really
    08:20
    upset a lot of Americans and the
    08:22
    government was ordered to stop the
    08:24
    natives from practicing the Ghost Dance
    08:25
    and natives also sought self-sustaining
    08:28
    economic practices such as farming where
    08:30
    they could provide for themselves
    08:31
    everything they need him all right some
    08:34
    testifed from multiple choices short
    08:35
    answer definitely know the reasons for
    08:36
    westward expansion ways immigrants
    08:38
    adapted to life in America what was the
    08:41
    impact of westward expansion on natives
    08:43
    absolutely no the Dawes Act for essays
    08:45
    comparing reasons for and effects /
    08:47
    experiences of immigration groups and
    08:49
    what was the impact of westward
    08:51
    expansion on Native Americans again I
    08:53
    mentioned this
    08:54
    it has been a long time since this
    08:55
    question has been asked on an AP exam I
    08:58
    would definitely be familiar with that
    09:00
    all right guys look forward to seeing
    09:01
    you back here for a key concept 6.3 and
    09:04
    we'll figure out who this dude is with
    09:05
    the sweet side burns thank you guys for
    09:07
    watching best of luck in May and all
    09:10

            captions = """
    00:03
    hey what's going on a push people we
    00:06
    have key concepts 6.3 for you today the
    00:08
    revised edition the most up-to-date key
    00:12
    concept six point three video that you
    00:14
    will find all right let's get started so
    00:16
    key concepts six point three states the
    00:18
    Gilded Age produced new cultural and
    00:20
    into intellectual movements public
    00:22
    reform efforts and political debates
    00:25
    over economic and social policies so the
    00:28
    big idea questions you can answer by the
    00:30
    time you're done with this video are
    00:31
    what were different examples of
    00:33
    discrimination that various groups faced
    00:35
    in the nineteenth century how to
    00:37
    business leaders and the wealthy justify
    00:40
    their wealth and how did summit society
    00:42
    criticize capitalism and what were the
    00:45
    alternatives they proposed okay let's
    00:47
    take a look at Roman numeral one it
    00:48
    states new cultural and intellectual
    00:50
    movements both buttress which means
    00:52
    provided and challenge the social order
    00:55
    of the Gilded Age so let's talk about
    00:58
    social Darwinism it's specifically
    00:59
    mentioned you need to know this this is
    01:02
    taking Charles Darwin's ideas of
    01:04
    evolution and kind of applying it to
    01:06
    humans and the best example of this is
    01:08
    survival of the fittest which was coined
    01:11
    by this dude Herbert Spencer and what he
    01:14
    argued in advocates of survival of the
    01:15
    fittest or social Darwinism argued is
    01:17
    that businesses and people could use any
    01:19
    tactics necessary to prosper so this is
    01:22
    where we see the emergence of things
    01:24
    like monopolies vertical and horizontal
    01:26
    integration and pools and the wealthy
    01:29
    said hey this is acceptable this is okay
    01:31
    because we were big and strong and
    01:33
    powerful and we are prospering so why
    01:36
    was it used again this was used to
    01:38
    justify the success of the wealthy that
    01:40
    could be a potential multiple choice
    01:42
    answer that you could encounter why
    01:44
    we're tactics like social Darwinism used
    01:47
    and again this states it is appropriate
    01:49
    and inevitable for the wealthy to
    01:51
    succeed in society so the gospel wealth
    01:56
    emerges during this time and this was
    01:57
    written by steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie
    02:01
    or Andrew Carnegie and he argued that
    02:03
    the wealthy should give back to society
    02:06
    and that's example philanthropy of
    02:07
    giving money away currently in the news
    02:10
    of people like Mark Zuckerberg
    02:12
    founder of Facebook who's pledged to
    02:14
    give away 99% of his wealth that's an
    02:17
    example of philanthropy so some examples
    02:20
    of philanthropy well Carnegie gave money
    02:21
    for hundreds of libraries throughout the
    02:24
    United States people who support the
    02:25
    gospel wealth didn't advocate just going
    02:27
    up and giving money to the poor but
    02:30
    rather giving money to community
    02:31
    organizations which would benefit
    02:33
    society Cornelius Vanderbilt gave a
    02:36
    million dollars to help establish
    02:37
    Vanderbilt University so the creation of
    02:40
    schools libraries and other societal
    02:44
    organizations are examples of the gospel
    02:47
    of wealth in action so there are some
    02:51
    alternative visions for the US economy
    02:53
    and the u.s. Society during this time we
    02:55
    have agrarians people who are farmers
    02:57
    they saw more government involvement in
    02:59
    the economy we saw this with a populist
    03:01
    party and they also advocated government
    03:03
    ownership of railroads and we also have
    03:05
    people like coxey's army this was a
    03:07
    group of people that march to Washington
    03:09
    in 1893 as a result of the panic of 1893
    03:12
    and they demanded relief in government
    03:13
    Works programs they were not accepted
    03:16
    their ideas were shut down but we will
    03:17
    see what they were calling for is very
    03:20
    similar to what FDR provides through New
    03:22
    Deal agencies utopian societies were
    03:26
    coming back to them we talked about them
    03:27
    during the time of the Second Great
    03:28
    Awakening in antebellum America an
    03:31
    example it's still run at this time is
    03:32
    Oneida community in New York and they
    03:34
    practice communal ownership where
    03:36
    everybody owned the land they also
    03:40
    practice free love and eugenics which is
    03:42
    selective breeding and that's something
    03:43
    that will continue over into the
    03:45
    Progressive Era they believed they could
    03:47
    improve human society by only allowing
    03:50
    certain people to procreate socialism is
    03:53
    an appealing idea during this time you
    03:55
    have people like Eugene V Debs who we'll
    03:56
    talk about more in the Progressive Era
    03:58
    they advocated for that the society is
    04:00
    more than just the one than just the
    04:02
    individual and they help promote human
    04:04
    welfare and the elimination of class
    04:06
    systems and Eugene Debs was an advocate
    04:09
    of government ownership of railroads so
    04:12
    really limiting the power of these
    04:14
    corporate tycoons and finally the social
    04:16
    gospel this is a Protestant church
    04:18
    movement to improve society so we see
    04:20
    the church getting involved in ways to
    04:22
    help improve society
    04:25
    okay let's take a look at Roman numeral
    04:26
    two it states dramatic social changes in
    04:28
    the period inspired political debates
    04:31
    over citizenship corruption and the
    04:33
    proper relationship between business and
    04:35
    government now the Republicans the
    04:37
    Democrats in the late 19th century you
    04:39
    must know characteristics of them the
    04:41
    solid south they will vote Democratic
    04:43
    pretty much from the end of the Civil
    04:46
    War until the 1960s the North tended to
    04:50
    vote mostly Republican now there were
    04:52
    some differences between the two parties
    04:53
    most notably tariffs Republicans
    04:56
    advocated raising tariffs remember
    04:58
    Republicans raised and Democrats
    04:59
    advocated lowering tariffs Democrats
    05:02
    want to see tariffs go down so that was
    05:04
    one issue the other issue was the
    05:06
    currency issue and in the election of
    05:08
    1896 we see the Republicans led by
    05:11
    William McKinley they favored the gold
    05:13
    standard or gold backing up the value of
    05:14
    the dollar and the Democrats led by
    05:17
    William Jennings Bryan who was also the
    05:19
    populist candidate they favored free
    05:21
    silver or allowing silver to back up the
    05:23
    value of the dollar as well and here's
    05:26
    an example the solid south you notice
    05:28
    it's all blue down here but ultimately
    05:30
    William McKinley prevails and the gold
    05:32
    standard leads the way
    05:34
    reformers argue that greed and
    05:36
    self-interest corrupted all levels of
    05:38
    government we see this on the local
    05:40
    level and with political machines
    05:42
    especially Tammany Hall in New York City
    05:44
    and on the federal level you see
    05:45
    patronage in which many government jobs
    05:48
    were given based on who you know and
    05:50
    also the election of senators by state
    05:52
    legislators that will be repealed with
    05:55
    the 17th amendment but there many people
    05:57
    argue that state legislators were
    05:59
    corrupt and would elect senators that
    06:01
    were favorable to big business so women
    06:03
    during this time they are seeking
    06:05
    greater equality by joining voluntary
    06:07
    organizations organizations like the
    06:09
    women's Christian Temperance Union which
    06:11
    sought to ban alcohol now play a role in
    06:13
    the formation of an eighteenth Amendment
    06:14
    and the National American Women's
    06:16
    Suffrage Association or the nawsa which
    06:19
    will play a key role in the formation of
    06:21
    the 19th amendment here you see susan b
    06:23
    anthony Elizabeth Cady Stanton two
    06:25
    prominent members of the nawsa nawsa as
    06:30
    I mentioned held lead to the passage of
    06:31
    the 19th amendment which granted women's
    06:34
    suffrage that was in 1920 going to
    06:37
    college we see the emergence of many
    06:38
    women
    06:38
    colleges although at this time it was
    06:40
    mostly seminaries and teaching women how
    06:42
    to be housewives you see women play an
    06:45
    active role in promoting social order
    06:47
    political reform Elizabeth Cady Stanton
    06:48
    again she was in leading suffragists and
    06:50
    she added she was also an advocate of
    06:52
    interracial marriage and women would
    06:54
    also work in settlement houses people
    06:56
    like Jane Addams who established the
    06:58
    Hall House in Chicago which helped women
    07:00
    children and immigrants adapt or
    07:02
    assimilate to American society and this
    07:04
    really helped inspire other settlement
    07:06
    houses throughout the United States in
    07:08
    1896 we have the court case Plessy vs.
    07:10
    Ferguson one of the worst decisions of
    07:13
    Supreme Court case history and they're
    07:14
    eight to one ruling everybody except
    07:17
    this guy John Marshall Harlan upheld
    07:20
    that racial segregation was okay as long
    07:22
    as separate facilities were equal so he
    07:24
    was the one guy who voted against the
    07:28
    rest of the Supreme Court justices and
    07:29
    Plessy versus Ferguson most gains made
    07:32
    by african-americans during
    07:33
    Reconstruction were severely limited the
    07:35
    13th 14th 15th amendments you have
    07:38
    things like sharecropping literacy tests
    07:40
    poll taxes the KKK which really limits
    07:43
    the effectiveness of these or of these
    07:45
    amendments and African American
    07:47
    reformers continue to fight for
    07:48
    political and social equality in the
    07:50
    face of many different obstacles
    07:52
    including violence you have people like
    07:54
    I to be wells who was a journalist that
    07:56
    was an outspoken critic of lynching and
    07:59
    she advocated a federal anti-lynching
    08:01
    law she was a very influential
    08:04
    journalist from the South during the
    08:05
    late 18 early 1900s you have Booker T
    08:09
    Washington who advocated vocational
    08:11
    training for African Americans and equal
    08:13
    economic opportunities so he helped
    08:16
    fight discrimination in the south and
    08:17
    there were scientific theories of race
    08:19
    during this time which some
    08:20
    anthropologists argue that African
    08:22
    Americans were inferior to whites and
    08:24
    they would use skull measurements and
    08:26
    other bogus ideas to justify their
    08:30
    beliefs ok let's finish up with some
    08:32
    test tips for multiple choice and short
    08:34
    answer Plessy versus Ferguson know it as
    08:36
    well as the impacts I didn't mention it
    08:38
    but that will be turned over turned by
    08:40
    Brown versus the Board of Education know
    08:42
    some alternative to alternatives to
    08:43
    capitalism and examples of
    08:45
    discrimination and how people countered
    08:47
    it whether it was women or
    08:48
    african-americans for essays you can see
    08:51
    an essay comparing forms
    08:52
    discrimination with other time period so
    08:54
    for examples what were the responses of
    08:56
    african-americans in 1890s to the 1920s
    08:58
    and african-americans in the 1950s in
    09:02
    the 1960 civil rights movement all right
    09:05
    guys thank you very much for watching I
    09:06

    00:00
    Oh what's going down a push peeps we
    00:01
    have a very important video for you
    00:04
    today this topic the people's or the
    00:06
    populist party is specifically mentioned
    00:09
    in the new curriculum it has its own
    00:10
    little section so you need to be
    00:12
    especially familiar with this topic but
    00:15
    don't worry we have you covered all
    00:17
    right let's take a look at the new
    00:18
    curriculum key concepts 6.1 Roman
    00:20
    numeral three letter C state's economic
    00:22
    instability inspired agrarian activists
    00:25
    to create the people's or populist party
    00:28
    which call for a stronger governmental
    00:30
    role in regulating the American economic
    00:32
    system again since its mentioned
    00:34
    anything about the party is fair game
    00:37
    for the test you should know that that
    00:38
    really is a focus on it being an
    00:40
    agrarian movement and other groups as
    00:42
    well see and advocating or favoring for
    00:45
    government intervention so a populist is
    00:48
    somebody who would have fate would favor
    00:50
    increased government intervention all
    00:53
    right so what is the populist party was
    00:55
    a political party from the late
    00:56
    nineteenth century made up of mostly
    00:59
    farmers they sought increased government
    01:01
    involvement in the economy to control
    01:03
    things like railroads banks and
    01:05
    government reform they especially wanted
    01:08
    the government to own railroads they
    01:10
    were very critical the economic system
    01:12
    which is capitalism and critical of
    01:14
    laissez-faire as well and it originated
    01:17
    in Cincinnati in May of 1891 you could
    01:21
    trace the origins to this beautiful city
    01:23
    right here look at that skyline is that
    01:26
    not amazing or what
    01:28
    alright so what groups of people support
    01:30
    the populist party well as we mentioned
    01:32
    before it's farmers it's predominantly
    01:34
    an agrarian movement groups like the
    01:36
    Grange which were groups that sought to
    01:39
    connect farmers and share techniques and
    01:41
    also they hope to elect state
    01:43
    legislatures that supported their
    01:45
    programs you also have like farmers
    01:47
    alliances this group that consisted of
    01:49
    mainly local organizations they
    01:51
    establish stores and banks to help
    01:53
    farmers out you also see some industrial
    01:56
    workers specifically the Knights of
    01:57
    Labor that union of skilled and
    02:00
    unskilled workers they would support the
    02:03
    pie plays party and don't forget that
    02:05
    the leader the Knights of Labor is this
    02:07
    dude with perhaps the most luscious
    02:09
    mustache in US history
    02:11
    Terrence Powderly
    02:13
    and also people who are in favor of
    02:14
    economic reform would fit would support
    02:18
    the populist party as well okay so what
    02:22
    led to the creation of the populist
    02:23
    party well economic issues such as the
    02:27
    growth of corporate power we have
    02:28
    railroads that are able to charge high
    02:31
    shipping rates that hurt farmers so
    02:33
    farmers are going to react to the high
    02:34
    shipping rates and want to restrict this
    02:37
    growth of corporate power railroads
    02:40
    often owned great elevators as well and
    02:43
    these were storage units often based on
    02:45
    rivers or lakes where farmers could
    02:47
    store their goods and they would charge
    02:48
    high rates to farmers in order to store
    02:51
    their goods we have two panics a panic
    02:53
    of 1873 and the panic of 1893 these
    02:57
    significantly hurt farmers as crop as
    02:59
    crop prices plummeted and the populist
    03:03
    party also emerged from previous
    03:04
    agrarian groups as we talked about the
    03:06
    Grange and also the farmers alliances
    03:08
    and here is a political cartoon they're
    03:10
    really kind of mocks the populist party
    03:12
    you'll see down here it says platform of
    03:14
    lunacy you know people like Terrence
    03:16
    Powderly right here and then you have
    03:17
    the People's Party and this hot-air
    03:19
    balloon is made up of a bunch of patches
    03:21
    of different groups you have the farmers
    03:23
    alliance the green bag party the Knights
    03:25
    of Labor the old Granger Party
    03:27
    socialists free silver party which we'll
    03:29
    talk about in just a couple minutes so
    03:30
    basically it's this collection of a wide
    03:33
    range of people so this artist here is
    03:36
    very critical of the populist party so
    03:39
    be familiar again any time you see a
    03:40
    political cartoon or document think
    03:43
    about what is the message of this and
    03:44
    what is the author's point of view and
    03:47
    his point of view here is very critical
    03:49
    of the populist party okay so what were
    03:52
    the goals of the pipe lists again they
    03:54
    sought economic relief as well as
    03:55
    government intervention I've mentioned
    03:56
    that several times so far with the Omaha
    03:58
    platform which really advocated their
    04:01
    1892 presidential platform and this was
    04:04
    written by this dude Ignatius Donnelly
    04:06
    perhaps the sweetest name in US history
    04:08
    Ignatius they called for the Omaha
    04:11
    platform call for the direct election of
    04:13
    senators instead of state legislatures
    04:15
    they also call for graduated income tax
    04:17
    meaning the more money you make the more
    04:18
    you pay in taxes the Australian or
    04:20
    secret ballot and government control of
    04:23
    railroads Telegraph's
    04:24
    and telephones again you see here
    04:26
    increase govern
    04:27
    involvement is a goal of the populist
    04:30
    party they also favored the free coinage
    04:32
    of silver silver at a ratio of 16 to one
    04:35
    with gold that is called bimetallism be
    04:38
    sure you can identify bimetallism what
    04:40
    this means is for every one ounce of
    04:42
    gold that was used to back up the dollar
    04:44
    the populace wanted 16 ounces of silver
    04:46
    to count as well and that would inflate
    04:49
    the currency making it easier for them
    04:51
    to pay off their debts and again 16
    04:54
    ounces of silver would equal one ounce
    04:56
    of gold this would increase the money
    04:57
    supply which would give farmers more
    04:59
    money which would make it easier for
    05:00
    them to pay off their debts but this
    05:02
    would be resisted by bankers and lenders
    05:04
    because their money would be worth less
    05:07
    they also come for a civil service
    05:08
    reform and an eight-hour workday but
    05:11
    definitely be familiar with this Omaha
    05:12
    platform here these five things because
    05:15
    we'll see some of them come to fruition
    05:17
    at a later time all right let's talk
    05:19
    about that election of 1892 we have
    05:21
    Grover Cleveland he is a Democrat versus
    05:23
    Benjamin Harrison a Republican and also
    05:26
    James Weaver a populist and here is
    05:29
    James Weaver and he campaigned on that
    05:31
    Omaha platform we just talked about now
    05:33
    if you look at James Weaver he looks
    05:34
    like pretty much every other politician
    05:36
    from the late 1800s here is James
    05:39
    Garfield they look identical and there
    05:41
    is Rufford be Hayes the former president
    05:45
    look at them they all could be the exact
    05:46
    same dude I feel like we're gonna play a
    05:48
    game later identify who is this person
    05:51
    and Weaver received 22 electoral votes
    05:54
    an 8.5% of the popular vote so he did
    05:57
    have a little bit of a showing but did
    05:59
    not become president flash forward four
    06:02
    years with William Jennings Bryan who
    06:04
    runs as a Democrat and gets the support
    06:06
    of the pipe list and he's gone up
    06:07
    against William McKinley who is a
    06:09
    Republican and the populist party
    06:11
    supported Bryan due to his support for
    06:13
    free silver that introduction of silver
    06:15
    at a 16 to 1 ratio with gold William
    06:18
    Jennings Bryan gives this very famous
    06:20
    speech called a cross of gold speech be
    06:22
    able to identify this as screaming to me
    06:25
    and excerpt to be using a
    06:27
    multiple-choice or a short answer
    06:28
    question so here he is at the Democratic
    06:31
    nomination in 1896 in the end of his kit
    06:34
    the end of this speech he says you shall
    06:36
    not press down upon the brow of Labor of
    06:38
    this crown of thorns you shall not
    06:41
    five man kind upon a cross of gold so he
    06:44
    was calling for the introduction of
    06:46
    silver again we have an excerpt so think
    06:49
    about who would support it who would not
    06:50
    support you would have farmers who would
    06:52
    support it I could see a multiple choice
    06:53
    question this is something to the effect
    06:55
    of all the following would agree with
    06:57
    William Jennings Bryan message accept
    07:00
    and you would have liked Midwestern
    07:01
    farmers would agree sharecroppers would
    07:03
    agree etc but then you could see like an
    07:06
    industrialist or a banker or something
    07:08
    they would not agree with it because it
    07:11
    would devalue their money so be able to
    07:13
    identify the cross of gold speech okay
    07:16
    so what was the impact of the populist
    07:17
    well many of the ideas and goals of the
    07:19
    populist party later came to fruition as
    07:21
    I mentioned earlier the income tax that
    07:23
    they call for that seen in the early
    07:25
    1900s with the sixteenth amendment as is
    07:27
    the direct election of senators with the
    07:29
    17th amendment in secret ballots as well
    07:31
    coming to play in the early 1900s and
    07:33
    this is all during the Progressive Era
    07:36
    which is a part of Teddy Roosevelt's
    07:38
    presidency this is a great connection to
    07:41
    another time period so even though the
    07:42
    pipe list party itself doesn't implement
    07:45
    these ideas their ideas will later be
    07:47
    implemented all right let's finish up
    07:50
    with some test tips for multiple choice
    07:51
    of short-answer be able to identify and
    07:53
    explain the reasons for the development
    07:55
    of the populist party the populist idea
    07:57
    is the most similar to that could be a
    07:58
    great question as well another time
    08:00
    period in US history no it's the
    08:01
    Progressive Era who would support the
    08:04
    populist party again farmers farmers
    08:05
    farmers and who would oppose it
    08:07
    industrialists bankers etc definitely no
    08:09
    crowd across the gold speech that we
    08:11
    just talked about and for essays you
    08:13
    could see an essay comparing farmers and
    08:15
    industrial workers their responses to
    08:18
    industrialization so how did farmers
    08:20
    respond how did industrial workers
    08:22
    respond how are they similar and how
    08:24
    were they different alright guys I thank
    08:26
    you very much for watching I wish you
    08:28
    nothing but the best of luck in May and
    08:29
    let me know who do you think this dude
    08:31
    is here he looks like every other
    08:32
    politician from the late 19th century
    08:33
    but take a guess leave in the comments
    08:35
    below and we'll see if anybody gets all
    08:37
    right thank you very much and have a

    00:27
    all right the gilded age a brief intro
    00:30
    this was a term that was coined by Mark
    00:32
    Twain Samuel Clemens and it is the idea
    00:35
    that although things appear to be good
    00:38
    on the surface societal problems existed
    00:41
    underneath a thin layer of gold so
    00:44
    although things appeared on the surface
    00:46
    to be good once you've dug a little
    00:48
    deeper you would see that things really
    00:50
    are not as good as they appeared on the
    00:52
    surface this time periods from 1870 to
    00:56
    1910 economic growth so let's jump over
    01:01
    to politics and economics during this
    01:03
    time here Republicans and Democrats they
    01:06
    were split primarily over economic
    01:09
    issues Republicans favored higher
    01:11
    tariffs and Democrats advocated lower
    01:14
    tariffs and here is a young
    01:16
    representative from Ohio named William
    01:19
    McKinley author of the McKinley tariff
    01:21
    of 1890 a very high tariff rate remember
    01:24
    if you see Republicans chances are
    01:26
    they're gonna favor high tariffs if you
    01:28
    see a Democrat chances are they're going
    01:30
    to favor low tariffs currency was
    01:32
    another issue that separated the two
    01:34
    political parties Republicans favored
    01:36
    the gold standard or having gold backup
    01:38
    the value of the dollar
    01:39
    whereas Democrats and the populist party
    01:41
    of 1896 they adopted a free silver which
    01:44
    means backing up the value of money with
    01:47
    silver in addition to golden here was
    01:50
    1896 populist and Democratic candidate
    01:53
    William Jennings Bryan a young 36 years
    01:56
    old when he ran for president this would
    01:59
    favor farmers and those in debt because
    02:01
    there would be more money in circulation
    02:02
    and it would actually cause inflation
    02:05
    and allow those in debt to pay off their
    02:08
    debt more easily and also during this
    02:10
    time there's a growing gap
    02:12
    the rich and the poor political machines
    02:15
    were seen on state and local levels
    02:17
    these were political organizations that
    02:19
    provided jobs and services to
    02:21
    constituents or their voters and receive
    02:24
    support and return from these voters the
    02:26
    most famous book of machine during this
    02:28
    time is Tammany Hall in New York City at
    02:29
    Democratic headquarters led by boss
    02:32
    tweed William Marcy tweed and he used
    02:35
    dishonest graft or stealing and bribing
    02:38
    to make lots of money at one point he
    02:40
    stole over 200 million dollars from New
    02:43
    York City technological advancements
    02:45
    were jumping over to during the Gilded
    02:47
    Age scientific management holy cow
    02:50
    definitely know this is mentioned the
    02:51
    new curriculum also known as Taylorism
    02:53
    named after its founder Frederick Taylor
    02:56
    and here is mr. Taylor this focused on
    02:59
    improving efficiency of workers workers
    03:02
    would often have time tasks and do the
    03:04
    same tasks over and over again
    03:07
    they were given specific tests and they
    03:08
    would be trained up for example they
    03:10
    were working on an assembly line they
    03:11
    would do one thing over and over again
    03:13
    they would not necessarily have more
    03:16
    than one task some inventions we see our
    03:19
    mechanized tractors and grain elevators
    03:21
    which leads to a huge increase of
    03:23
    production of crops for farmers and the
    03:25
    Bessemer process allowed for people like
    03:28
    Carnegie to mass-produce steel on levels
    03:31
    never before seen business consolidation
    03:34
    during the Gilded Age when you think of
    03:35
    trust think of monopolies they're often
    03:37
    associated with monopolies monopolies
    03:40
    holding companies this is where one
    03:41
    company that owned stock and many other
    03:43
    companies and essentially controls them
    03:45
    vertical integration was pioneered
    03:47
    during this time this is owning all
    03:49
    aspects of production of a business from
    03:51
    start to finish this is something that
    03:53
    Carnegie did with his steel production
    03:55
    and also horizontal integration this was
    03:58
    popularized by this dude Rockefeller
    04:00
    this is where businesses in an industry
    04:02
    joined together in form a monopolies
    04:04
    buying out your competition unions
    04:06
    developed during the Gilded Age and two
    04:08
    predominant ones that you should be
    04:10
    familiar with are the Knights of Labor
    04:11
    and the American Federation of Labor and
    04:14
    they emerged as a response to working
    04:16
    conditions and wages the Knights of
    04:18
    Labor led by Terrence Powderly and his
    04:20
    unbelievably amazing mustache consistent
    04:23
    of skilled and unskilled workers
    04:25
    the American Federation of Labor led by
    04:27
    Samuel Gompers with quite the moustache
    04:29
    of his own consisted of skilled workers
    04:31
    and focused on bread-and-butter issues
    04:34
    things like higher wages better working
    04:36
    conditions eight-hour days there were so
    04:40
    many strikes during the Gilded Age you
    04:41
    should be familiar with they were often
    04:43
    a reaction to wage cuts by businesses
    04:46
    the great railroad strike of 1877 was
    04:49
    broken up by federal troops under
    04:51
    President Hayes the Haymarket Square
    04:53
    riot of 1886 this was a protest for an
    04:57
    eight-hour workday in Chicago that
    04:59
    turned violent when someone threw a bomb
    05:01
    and the Knights of Labor were unfairly
    05:03
    blamed for this the Homestead Strike was
    05:06
    a strike at a Carnegie steel plant and
    05:08
    then the Pullman strike was over the
    05:11
    Pullman Palace car company when the
    05:13
    company cut wages and they did not cut
    05:15
    rent prices in the town of Pullman and
    05:18
    in every single one of these strikes
    05:22
    here you'll see the government will side
    05:24
    against unions and with businesses and
    05:26
    breaking up these strikes farmers during
    05:30
    the Gilded Age definitely know the
    05:31
    populist party I have a video on that be
    05:33
    familiar with this organization so as
    05:37
    they respond to the growth of corporate
    05:38
    power specifically railroads and
    05:40
    economic instability and they wanted the
    05:43
    government to have a stronger role in
    05:44
    the economy this is very important
    05:46
    circle this right now for me if you're
    05:49
    using my video guide they wanted the
    05:50
    government to have a stronger role in
    05:52
    the economy they advocated things like a
    05:54
    graduated income tax which means you
    05:57
    would pay a higher percentage of income
    05:59
    tax the more money you make they favored
    06:02
    free silver which is the introduction of
    06:04
    silver to back up the value of money as
    06:06
    well and direct election of senators and
    06:09
    here is a poster of the people's part of
    06:13
    your populist party candidate from 1892
    06:15
    the presidential election some key terms
    06:19
    you should be familiar with social
    06:21
    Darwinism coffin used by Herbert
    06:23
    sideburn Spencer and this is a survival
    06:25
    the fittest applied to businesses that
    06:27
    businesses could do whatever they want
    06:29
    or need in order to succeed this was
    06:33
    used to justify the success of
    06:34
    businesses and the wealthy the gospel
    06:37
    wealth definitely know this bad boy the
    06:39
    as Andrew Carnegie is advocated for
    06:41
    wealthy individuals to give back to
    06:43
    society this is known as philanthropy
    06:44
    they should give their money to the
    06:46
    community into better society some
    06:48
    examples of this Vanderbilt University
    06:50
    when Cornelius Vanderbilt gave a million
    06:52
    dollars to create this university and
    06:54
    Carnegie gave countless money for for
    06:56
    hundreds and thousands of libraries
    06:58
    throughout this country social gospel
    07:01
    was a Protestant church movement to
    07:02
    improve society you would see the church
    07:05
    create reading rooms nurseries and other
    07:07
    services for the needy throughout this
    07:09
    country Interstate Commerce Act of 1887
    07:12
    allowed the government to invent to
    07:14
    investigate railroads but it was mostly
    07:16
    symbolic at first so this is the first
    07:19
    step of God of the government starting
    07:20
    to intervene and limit the power of
    07:23
    business and the Sherman Antitrust Act
    07:26
    from 1890 was when the federal
    07:28
    government could investigate trusts and
    07:29
    this will later be strengthened during
    07:31
    the Progressive Era and the 1900s so
    07:34
    just know with interstate commerce sites
    07:36
    in the Sherman Antitrust Act you begin
    07:38
    to see the government become more
    07:39
    involved in regulating businesses okay
    07:42
    for some tests it's multiple choice and
    07:44
    short answer definitely know the reasons
    07:46
    for the creation and impacts of unions
    07:49
    consolidation of businesses and the
    07:51
    populist party all three of those could
    07:52
    be great short answer questions
    07:54
    differences between Republicans and
    07:56
    Democrats be able to explain those
    07:58
    especially when it comes to currency in
    07:59
    tariffs and for assays and dbq's you can
    08:02
    see something on the impact of
    08:03
    technology and workers and businesses
    08:05
    during this time period as well thank
    08:08
    you guys very much for watching I do

    00:00
    hey what's going on ap people we have a
    00:03
    video for you today on new immigration
    00:05
    which is immigration that occurs after
    00:07
    the Civil War hopefully you've watched
    00:08
    the video I did on old immigration if
    00:11
    not there is a link in the description
    00:12
    for you to watch and also if you want to
    00:15
    download the PowerPoint that is used in
    00:16
    this video please have the link in the
    00:18
    description to head on over to a push
    00:19
    review com where you can download this
    00:21
    PowerPoint and every other one that I
    00:23
    have for all my videos alright let's get
    00:25
    going so what exactly is new immigration
    00:28
    well these are immigrants that came from
    00:30
    southern in Eastern Europe now old
    00:33
    immigrants came from northern in Western
    00:35
    Europe so new immigration is going to
    00:37
    come from a different part of Europe and
    00:39
    against Southern and Eastern Europe you
    00:41
    definitely have to know that they came
    00:42
    from southern in Eastern Europe and many
    00:44
    of them came through New York City in
    00:46
    Ellis Island here's a picture from the
    00:48
    early 1900s of of immigrants coming
    00:51
    through from Ellis Island and often one
    00:52
    of the first things they saw was the
    00:54
    Statue of Liberty when they would come
    00:56
    over here so what are the specific
    00:59
    countries that are involved with new
    01:01
    immigrants we know it's southern in
    01:03
    Eastern Europe but we need to know that
    01:04
    it is Poland Italy Greece Hungary etc so
    01:07
    those again those countries on the
    01:10
    eastern portion of Europe when did it
    01:13
    occur mainly occur between the 1880s in
    01:16
    1920 we'll see that something happens in
    01:18
    the 1920s that kind of that limits
    01:20
    immigration alright why did they come
    01:23
    here where did they settle why they came
    01:26
    here well one reason was for Economic
    01:28
    Opportunity see some of these immigrants
    01:30
    came for a very short time to make money
    01:32
    then they would go back home and send
    01:34
    that money back home and then they would
    01:35
    go back home to be with their families
    01:37
    those are called birds of passage there
    01:39
    also is a lack of military conscription
    01:41
    or a draft here in many countries in
    01:44
    Europe at the time had a draft for their
    01:46
    citizens and you see certain groups of
    01:49
    people including Jews that come here due
    01:51
    to religious persecution so again it's
    01:53
    really the same reasons why people have
    01:55
    come to the United States throughout
    01:57
    history its economic and religious
    01:59
    opportunities and where did they settle
    02:02
    overwhelmingly these groups settled in
    02:04
    urban areas we saw with old immigration
    02:07
    the Germans tended to settle on the
    02:08
    frontier and the Irish tended to settle
    02:11
    on the East Coast and we'll see that the
    02:12
    new immigrants
    02:13
    we'll settle a lot of times on the East
    02:15
    Coast but overwhelmingly in urban areas
    02:17
    you'll see it in large cities like New
    02:19
    York City and Chicago in the living
    02:22
    apartments called dumbbell tenements and
    02:24
    here's a picture of a dumbbell tenement
    02:25
    they're very very crowded very
    02:27
    unsanitary you absolutely positively
    02:29
    must know this guy this is Jacob Riis
    02:32
    who was a photojournalist he was
    02:34
    actually buddies with Teddy Roosevelt
    02:35
    when he was the police commissioner of
    02:37
    New York City and he would use
    02:39
    photographs to document how these poor
    02:42
    urban immigrants lived and Jacob Riis
    02:45
    and how the other half lives appears
    02:46
    quite often on the a.push exam so
    02:48
    definitely be familiar with him if
    02:50
    you've ever seen the show cheers he
    02:52
    looks a lot like cliff Clavin you should
    02:53
    look him up all right so what were some
    02:56
    challenges faced by new immigrants many
    02:58
    had a hard time assimilating or
    03:01
    adjusting to American life and remember
    03:03
    that it the term assimilating we've seen
    03:05
    it with Native Americans with the Dawes
    03:06
    Act this is the idea of trying to make
    03:08
    people become American it was one of the
    03:12
    reasons why they had a hard time
    03:12
    assimilating was that they spoke
    03:14
    different languages and many of these
    03:16
    immigrants were highly illiterate as
    03:18
    well they would often live in ghettos
    03:20
    new immigrants often worked in unskilled
    03:23
    jobs and they would often work for lower
    03:25
    wages and that would really upset
    03:27
    american-born workers here is a
    03:30
    political cartoon from puck magazine and
    03:32
    you see here that this business owner is
    03:34
    hiring all of these immigrants coming
    03:37
    off this boat over here but this
    03:38
    American guy with his family is stuck is
    03:41
    out of a job because immigrants are
    03:43
    taking his job so that was a common
    03:45
    theme with old immigrants as well and
    03:47
    think that - Nina no I wish neat apply
    03:49
    in different ways to discriminate
    03:52
    against immigrants same thing as well
    03:53
    the same thing is going on here with new
    03:55
    immigrants they were also hard to
    03:57
    unionize because there was that language
    03:58
    barrier and we're going to see political
    04:01
    bosses often gave immigrants jobs and
    04:03
    resources this is the famous Tammany
    04:05
    Hall in New York City this is where
    04:07
    you'll see some corruption going on in
    04:09
    Tammany Hall and immigrants became a
    04:11
    very strong voting presence they tended
    04:14
    to vote Democrat in these big cities
    04:18
    okay let's talk about the reaction of
    04:20
    the new immigrants very important person
    04:22
    to know we have gene Adams from Chicago
    04:24
    she was the founder of this play
    04:26
    the whole house which was a settlement
    04:28
    house which helped provide housing food
    04:31
    and education for poor women and
    04:32
    immigrants this was a way to help
    04:34
    immigrants adjust to American life and
    04:37
    this helped spur other faiths other
    04:39
    settlement houses but the most famous
    04:41
    settlement house is the hall House with
    04:43
    Jane Addams in Chicago you absolutely
    04:45
    positively need to know her nativism we
    04:47
    talked about in the old immigrant video
    04:49
    again it's a fear distrust and hatred of
    04:51
    foreigners and some causes of nativism
    04:54
    it's always going to be taking jobs
    04:55
    we'll see a lot of these new immigrants
    04:58
    are Catholic coming from Southern and
    05:00
    Eastern Europe and there will be this
    05:01
    fear of the Pope and also some of these
    05:04
    groups will have different government
    05:06
    Diaz will be a lot of socialism and even
    05:07
    some anarchism which will frighten some
    05:10
    Americans and we'll see this group
    05:12
    develop the American Protective
    05:13
    Association also known as the APA and
    05:16
    they urged voting's against Catholics
    05:18
    and they favored tougher immigration
    05:20
    laws this is a lot like the know-nothing
    05:22
    party from the 1840s and 50s okay let's
    05:25
    talk about the immigration laws in the
    05:27
    1920s but before we do we have to look
    05:29
    at the past censuses since I so if we
    05:33
    look at 1881 to 1890 we'll see that
    05:36
    overwhelmingly most immigrants are from
    05:38
    northern and western Europe but as the
    05:40
    time goes on we're going to see more and
    05:42
    more southern and eastern or new
    05:44
    immigrants coming over but something
    05:46
    happens in the 20s that reverses that
    05:48
    will figure it out so in 1921 we have
    05:51
    the emergency quota act of 1921 and this
    05:53
    restricted the number of immigrants from
    05:55
    a country to 3% of the total people from
    05:58
    that country living in the u.s. in 1910
    06:01
    so I'm going to make it simple because
    06:03
    on my math teacher let's say in 1910
    06:05
    there are a hundred Italians living in
    06:08
    the United States that means according
    06:11
    to the emergency quota act of 1921 only
    06:13
    three Italian immigrants can come over
    06:16
    to the United States so this is a way to
    06:18
    severely restrict immigration it's
    06:20
    important to know the Year 1910 and this
    06:23
    is going to favor Southern and Eastern
    06:24
    Europe because there's a lot of
    06:25
    immigrants here you can see it basically
    06:27
    three-quarters of the immigrants in 1910
    06:30
    were from Southern and Eastern Europe
    06:33
    definitely hurts the amount of
    06:35
    immigrants coming in but still pretty
    06:36
    favorable to southern in Eastern Europe
    06:38
    so three years later
    06:40
    Congress passes another acted National
    06:42
    Origins Act of 1924 this cuts the quota
    06:45
    from 3 percent down to 2 percent so even
    06:48
    less are coming in but instead of the
    06:50
    1910 census Congress is going to use the
    06:53
    1890 census and that's going to hurt new
    06:56
    immigrants let's take a look at this
    06:57
    again in 1890 you'll see that the new
    07:00
    immigrants is very small here it's
    07:02
    probably about what they look like
    07:04
    one-sixth one-fifth so it's really going
    07:07
    to hurt these new immigrants and that
    07:09
    will favor the old immigrant so you
    07:12
    really this number here you can leave
    07:14
    two percent of a specific country coming
    07:16
    in in these two acts signified an end to
    07:19
    previously unrestricted immigration
    07:22
    you'll see that for the most part there
    07:24
    was no restrictions on immigration from
    07:27
    Europe we did have the Chinese Exclusion
    07:28
    Act in 1882 that's a little different
    07:30
    that's not a part of the new immigration
    07:33
    all right thank you very much watching
    07:35
    hopefully that helps clarify what new
    07:37
    immigration is it is not please take a

    00:00
    going on a push people we have a video
    00:01
    for you today on Tammany Hall and boss
    00:04
    tweed so we have a little politics
    00:06
    during the Gilded Age for you on the
    00:08
    docket today so let's get going
    00:10
    little background info on Tammany Hall
    00:11
    no starters on Tammany Hall was
    00:13
    established in the late 18th century
    00:15
    it's the late 1700s it was very
    00:17
    influential in the election of 1800 and
    00:20
    it helped New York State ultimately vote
    00:23
    for Thomas Jefferson Aaron Burr played a
    00:25
    key role with this so what exactly is
    00:27
    Tammany Hall you hear this lot well it
    00:29
    was a political machine ok what the heck
    00:31
    is a political machine well this is an
    00:33
    organization the held tremendous
    00:35
    influence in New York City so political
    00:37
    machine Timmy Hall is just a group of
    00:39
    people and often what they would do is
    00:41
    encourage the public to vote for Tammany
    00:43
    men and these Tammany men would be
    00:45
    politicians whether they're mayor's
    00:46
    governors legislators you needed and
    00:49
    they rewarded voters with patronage so
    00:52
    they would often tell people hey you
    00:53
    vote for our guy you vote for this
    00:55
    candidate and we will give you a job we
    00:58
    give you something in return for your
    01:01
    votes many mayors of New York City and
    01:03
    even governors in New York work Tammany
    01:05
    met as we will see throughout the second
    01:08
    half of the 19th century and early 20th
    01:10
    centuries Tammany Hall had tremendous
    01:12
    influence not only in New York City of
    01:13
    in New York State as well so let's start
    01:16
    talking about what graft is this is
    01:17
    important to understand Tammany Hall
    01:19
    graft is using political power for
    01:22
    personal gain now there's two types of
    01:24
    graft you should be familiar with one
    01:25
    it's honest graft and the next is
    01:27
    dishonest graft honest graft is using
    01:29
    inside information for personal gain and
    01:31
    this was popularized by man by the name
    01:33
    of George Washington Plunkett here is
    01:36
    George Plunkett and this is what he said
    01:38
    there's an honest graft and I'm an
    01:40
    example of how it works
    01:41
    I might sum up the whole thing by saying
    01:43
    I see my opportunities and I took them
    01:46
    just let me explain by examples my
    01:48
    party's a power in the city and it's
    01:49
    going to undertake a lot of public
    01:51
    improvements well I'm tipped off say
    01:53
    that there's going that they're going to
    01:55
    to lay out a new park at a certain place
    01:57
    I see my opportunity and I take it I go
    02:00
    to that place and I buy up all the land
    02:01
    I can in the neighborhood then the board
    02:04
    of this or that makes its play in public
    02:06
    and there's a rush to get my land which
    02:08
    nobody cared particular for before ain't
    02:11
    it perfectly asked to charge a good
    02:12
    price and make a profit
    02:13
    vestment in foresight of course it is
    02:15
    well that's honest graft so plug it
    02:18
    would buy a plan based on inside
    02:19
    information its celled at a higher price
    02:21
    that's honest graph dishonest graft is
    02:24
    stealing bribery etc this was
    02:27
    popularized by William boss tweed
    02:29
    alright let's get into boss tweed he was
    02:32
    a arguably the most famous member of
    02:34
    Tammany Hall and often times you will
    02:36
    see him depicted in political cartoons
    02:38
    he was a part of the Tweed ring that
    02:40
    stole up to 200 million dollars from New
    02:43
    York City and they did this by giving
    02:45
    high contracts for friends and workers a
    02:47
    plaster in a courthouse that built a
    02:50
    courthouse made something like two
    02:51
    hundred thousand dollars a ridiculous
    02:53
    amount of money for their work Thomas
    02:56
    Nast absolutely positively known Thomas
    02:58
    Nast he was an influential political
    03:00
    cartoonist here he is with a sweet
    03:02
    goatee some famous political cartoons
    03:05
    you see here the tweetering everybody's
    03:07
    blaming each other as who is responsible
    03:09
    and here is boss tweed off to the center
    03:12
    there we also have this political
    03:14
    cartoon in which a tiger is killing lady
    03:17
    democracy and you see that boss tweet up
    03:20
    here it's kind of the head of this he's
    03:22
    the Emperor in charge there and he
    03:25
    Thomas das was also a staunch critic of
    03:27
    tweed in Tammany Hall he publicized
    03:31
    countless political cartoons that made
    03:33
    people recognize who boss tweed was boss
    03:35
    tweed actually didn't care if you wrote
    03:37
    bad stories about him because as he said
    03:39
    his constituents could have read he
    03:41
    cared mostly about the pictures
    03:42
    everybody could understand pictures so
    03:45
    we have Samuel Tilden you may remember
    03:46
    him from the compromise of 1877 if not
    03:49
    check out that video in the description
    03:50
    below
    03:51
    he plays a very key role in tweeds
    03:54
    downfall
    03:55
    this helps catapult him to the
    03:56
    Democratic nomination in the election of
    03:58
    1876 which is also known as the
    04:00
    compromise of 1877 and just on a side
    04:03
    note ultimately boss tweed will be
    04:05
    caught because of the political cartoons
    04:07
    by Thomas Nast where he will go to jail
    04:09
    and later die let's go to Tammany Hall
    04:12
    in the early 20th century well in 1911
    04:14
    there's a Triangle Shirtwaist Factory
    04:15
    fire this happens in march 25th of that
    04:18
    year this is by far the work worst
    04:20
    workplace disaster new york city history
    04:23
    up until 9/11 hundred plus workers
    04:27
    mostly
    04:27
    women died many as young as ages 14 and
    04:30
    15 years old so Tammany Hall is gonna
    04:33
    play a very key role in new workplace
    04:36
    laws many people were protesting and
    04:39
    asking for tighter workplace laws safer
    04:42
    laws like not having fire exits blocked
    04:46
    the Tammany Hall was able to get the New
    04:48
    York state government to pass quite a
    04:49
    few laws that improved worker safety
    04:52
    progressive political changes like the
    04:54
    secret ballot of the Progressive Era
    04:56
    weaken the influence of political
    04:58
    machines and here's a very famous
    05:00
    cartoon you see boss tweed again in
    05:02
    there it ain't used to be a secret
    05:03
    ballot you would actually go to a place
    05:05
    like Tammany Hall and tell whoever is in
    05:08
    charge or who you were voting for in
    05:09
    boss tweed which stated they're innocent
    05:11
    counting their strength imagine somebody
    05:14
    going to boss tweed and telling them
    05:15
    that they wanted to vote for somebody
    05:16
    other than the Tammany mint probably
    05:18
    what had happened too often and by the
    05:21
    1960s Tammany was no longer in power so
    05:25
    I had quite a run there about a hundred
    05:26
    sixteen hundred seventy years that they
    05:28
    were in power for but no longer today
    05:30
    are they empowered all right some test
    05:33
    tips for Tammany Hall and boss tweed not
    05:35
    you're not very likely to see an essay
    05:37
    topic on Tammany Hall itself but rather
    05:39
    you definitely could include it into an
    05:42
    essay on politics during the Gilded Age
    05:44
    or corruption during the Gilded Age just
    05:46
    as an example of what was happening in
    05:48
    America tips for multiple choice
    05:50
    questions this is where you're more
    05:51
    likely to see Tammany Hall embossed we'd
    05:53
    definitely be familiar with political
    05:55
    cartoons emboss tweet especially this
    05:57
    one I've seen this one before these do
    05:59
    you're likely see bus Suites in the form
    06:02
    of a political cartoon so be able to
    06:03
    recognize him what the message of the
    06:05
    cartoon is do not sleep on Thomas Nast
    06:08
    make sure you remember his name be able
    06:10
    to identify him and he is the one that
    06:12
    made all those political cartoons and
    06:14
    don't forget about the Triangle
    06:15
    Shirtwaist Factory fire also and finally
    06:19
    good luck because you know you'll do
    06:20

    00:00
    hey what's up baby push people we have
    00:02
    pools for you today integrations both
    00:04
    horizontal and vertical and interlocking
    00:08
    directorates lots of business practices
    00:09
    that you should be familiar with during
    00:12
    the late to 19th century so we're gonna
    00:14
    start off talking about pools today and
    00:15
    what our pools well a pool is when firms
    00:18
    would agree to divide up an area amongst
    00:21
    themselves so they would take a market
    00:23
    and each firm would essentially have
    00:25
    control of a specific area of that
    00:28
    market they would have a monopoly in
    00:30
    that market and this would enable them
    00:31
    to share in the profits this was used
    00:34
    especially by railroad companies and in
    00:37
    the late 19th century we're going to see
    00:39
    that the railroad companies are the ones
    00:40
    that people who want to change business
    00:43
    practices of are going to go after so
    00:45
    they'll wanna change the business
    00:46
    practices of railroads later in 1887
    00:50
    this is outlawed by the Interstate
    00:52
    Commerce Act which creates the
    00:54
    Interstate Commerce Commission and the
    00:57
    main goal this was to outlaw pools and
    00:59
    rebates as well which is essentially
    01:01
    free passes given to individuals
    01:04
    particularly senators and then you'll
    01:06
    see here is a political cartoon from PUC
    01:08
    magazine and you'll notice that the
    01:10
    railroad tycoons down here are asking
    01:13
    Uncle Sam to be able to raise their
    01:15
    rates because it's also outlawed certain
    01:17
    types of high rates and you can see
    01:19
    Cornelius Vanderbilt to the background
    01:20
    the ghost of him in shock that the
    01:22
    government is kind of having this effect
    01:25
    on the railroad industry okay to
    01:28
    integrations you should know vertical is
    01:30
    the first one this was made popular by
    01:32
    Andrew Carnegie and his steel company
    01:34
    there is good old Andrew so what is
    01:37
    vertical integration well this is when a
    01:39
    business controls all aspects of
    01:41
    production from beginning to end so an
    01:43
    example Carnegie steel he would control
    01:46
    the production for beginning to add
    01:48
    every single thing that went into making
    01:50
    steel was owned by Andrew Carnegie
    01:52
    so no outside company had anything to do
    01:55
    with making steel so from the beginning
    01:57
    to the very end it is touched only by
    01:59
    Carnegie steel and here is Carnegie
    02:01
    steel located in Pittsburgh
    02:05
    so why was is used well it would help
    02:07
    reduce cost there's no middleman it's
    02:09
    all you and it would keep everything
    02:10
    in-house was this legal and the answer
    02:13
    is yes it is legal to have vertical
    02:16
    integration let's go to horizontal
    02:19
    integration this was popularized by John
    02:21
    Rockefeller and his Standard Oil Company
    02:23
    there is John what is it it is when
    02:27
    businesses within an industry join
    02:29
    together and create a monopoly an
    02:31
    example Rockefeller Standard Oil he
    02:34
    would align with other companies both
    02:36
    when buying them out and dividing up the
    02:38
    market and he control about 90% of the
    02:40
    oil production in the United States at
    02:42
    one time lots of oil right there so the
    02:46
    question is was this legal eventually no
    02:49
    in the beginning it was but eventually
    02:50
    it becomes illegal finally we will
    02:52
    finish up with this guy JP Morgan and
    02:54
    interlocking directorates so what
    02:57
    exactly are these well it's when a Board
    02:59
    of director serves on multiple serves on
    03:01
    the board of multiple competing
    03:02
    companies so somebody could serve on the
    03:05
    Board of Directors for JP Morgan's bank
    03:07
    and they would also serve as a director
    03:09
    on a competing bank so again you have JP
    03:12
    Morgan in the baking industry one person
    03:14
    would serve on multiple boards of
    03:16
    different banks this was used to control
    03:19
    multiple businesses in the same industry
    03:20
    and was this legal eventually no in 1914
    03:25
    with the Clayton Antitrust Act which
    03:27
    prohibited this in the same industry so
    03:29
    you could not serve on multiple boards
    03:31
    within the same industry
    03:33
    all right that's everything you need to
    03:34
    know about those four business practices

    00:02
    hey what's going on ap people we have
    00:04
    one of the more important elections of
    00:06
    the 19th century the election of 1896 we
    00:10
    have waited Jennings Bryan versus
    00:12
    William McKinley's the tube Williams
    00:15
    against each other often does that
    00:16
    happen huh all right let's get going so
    00:19
    some background info while Grover
    00:20
    Cleveland who was a 22nd and 24th
    00:23
    President of the United States is not
    00:25
    read on nated by the Democrats he was
    00:28
    hurtin large part by the panic of 1893
    00:31
    and this panic hurt many Americans but
    00:34
    especially farmers and that's who
    00:36
    William Jennings Bryan is going to
    00:37
    appeal to during this election at its
    00:40
    worst twenty percent of Americans were
    00:42
    unemployed that still is short of the
    00:45
    Great Depression where you ought where
    00:47
    you did see 25 percent of Americans who
    00:49
    were unemployed and the currency issue
    00:52
    dominated politics while I'm talking
    00:54
    about the currency issue I'm talking
    00:55
    about gold versus silver hopefully I'll
    00:57
    be able to clarify that in this video
    00:59
    because this is a huge huge topic in the
    01:02
    late 19th century okay let's get to know
    01:06
    the candidates the Democratic candidate
    01:07
    is a dark horse candidate by the name of
    01:10
    William Jennings Bryan and here is
    01:12
    William he was 36 years old when he was
    01:14
    nominated like my political hero Henry
    01:17
    Clay he runs for president three times
    01:20
    and loses every single time at least
    01:23
    clay spread it out Wayne James Bryan
    01:25
    lost in 1896 1900 and 1908 so three out
    01:29
    of four presidential elections he lost
    01:31
    that poor guy he was an incredible
    01:35
    orator for his time at the Democratic
    01:37
    convention he gave a famous speech which
    01:39
    is known as the cross of gold speech and
    01:41
    definitely know the cross of gold speech
    01:42
    and he actually invigorates the
    01:45
    convention and they carry him away they
    01:46
    are so excited about his speech and he
    01:49
    ends us by saying you shall not press
    01:51
    down upon the brow of Labor this crown
    01:54
    of four thorns you shall not crucify
    01:57
    mankind upon a cross of gold we'll see
    02:00
    what that means in just a few minutes so
    02:02
    the Republican candidate is William
    02:04
    McKinley the former Congress meant from
    02:07
    Ohio and author of the very high tariff
    02:09
    the McKinley tariff which was passed in
    02:11
    1890
    02:13
    mark Hana this guy is essentially
    02:15
    McKinley's campaign manager and he
    02:18
    builds a huge war chest of funds that
    02:20
    the Republicans actually have like five
    02:22
    times as much money as the Democrats in
    02:26
    William Jennings Bryan so this is really
    02:28
    like one of the first modern-day
    02:29
    campaigns and you see campaign managers
    02:32
    really start to play a crucial role in
    02:34
    elections so the issues in the campaign
    02:37
    well the free silver and this is
    02:38
    something that William Jennings Bryan
    02:40
    will campaign on and this is favored by
    02:42
    Bryan and the Democrats and also the
    02:44
    populist and they advocated or favored
    02:47
    the free and unlimited coinage of silver
    02:49
    at a 16 to 1 ratio and here is one of
    02:52
    his political posters from the 1896
    02:55
    campaign but let's figure out what the
    02:57
    heck does that mean well 16 ounces of
    02:59
    silver would equal one ounce of gold so
    03:03
    why is Bryan advocating this why does he
    03:05
    want to introduce silver into the
    03:08
    economy it would increase the money
    03:10
    supply so more money would be available
    03:12
    which would lead to inflation this would
    03:14
    help this inflation would help those
    03:16
    that are less wealthy particularly
    03:18
    farmers and debtors know that those that
    03:21
    Oh money if you owe money somebody and
    03:23
    now more money is in circulation that
    03:25
    money becomes worth less and that will
    03:27
    be easier to repay however wealthy
    03:29
    individuals will be against that bankers
    03:32
    and people who are lenders so the
    03:34
    Republicans will oppose that then we
    03:36
    have tariffs which is another big issue
    03:38
    and all throughout the 19th century and
    03:40
    remember Republicans favored high
    03:42
    protective tariffs Republicans wanted to
    03:44
    raise tariffs and here is McKinley's
    03:48
    campaign poster from 1896 and you see in
    03:51
    the top left it says protection our home
    03:54
    defender so they were in favor of really
    03:56
    high protective tariffs that would
    03:58
    protect American industries that is a
    04:00
    theme of Republicans throughout the 19th
    04:03
    and early 20th century they want to
    04:05
    raise tariffs I say that in a lot of
    04:07
    videos very important guys please
    04:09
    remember that and there it is again
    04:10
    remember Republicans want to raise
    04:12
    tariffs conversely Democrats want to
    04:14
    decrease tariffs McKinley was known for
    04:17
    giving front porch speeches at his home
    04:20
    in Canton Ohio and Brian did a railroad
    04:23
    campaign so here is McKinley's front
    04:25
    porch and
    04:26
    Canton Ohio and he gave speeches to
    04:28
    about 70,000 people they would show up
    04:30
    and he would just stand on his porch and
    04:32
    talk to them imagine that just going to
    04:33
    the home of a candidate pretty cool
    04:35
    whereas Brian traveled the country by
    04:37
    rail roads and you can see here here is
    04:39
    a map of where he traveled he had a lot
    04:41
    of the Midwest traveled over he traveled
    04:45
    thousands of miles spreading his message
    04:47
    so what are the resultant impact well
    04:49
    McKinley defeats Brian 271 to 176 and
    04:53
    the electoral college you can see here
    04:56
    that overwhelmingly the North is going
    04:58
    to vote for McKinley and the south is
    05:00
    going to vote for Brian and keep in mind
    05:02
    at this time the South traditionally
    05:04
    votes Democratic that is known as the
    05:06
    solid south so McKinley versus Bryan is
    05:08
    going to happen again in 1900 I will be
    05:12
    defeated this will be the beginning of
    05:14
    or the continuation really but also the
    05:16
    beginning Republican dominance in the
    05:17
    oval office
    05:18
    aside from Grover Cleveland and Woodrow
    05:22
    Wilson you'll see a lot of Republicans
    05:24
    including McKinley Roosevelt and Taft
    05:26
    and Bryan's hope of free silver will not
    05:29
    happen to kill even Republicans will not
    05:30
    allow it to happen
    05:32

    05:34

    00:03
    hey what's going on ap peeps we have one
    00:06
    of the most important court cases in US
    00:08
    history for you today Plessy vs.
    00:10
    Ferguson from 1896 so let's figure out
    00:13
    what exactly is going on this court case
    00:16
    will have far-reaching effects for
    00:18
    decades and decades and decades to come
    00:20
    okay some key ideas before the court
    00:22
    case let's review really quickly the
    00:24
    Reconstruction Amendments which are the
    00:26
    13th 14th and 15th amendments remember
    00:29
    the 13th amendment abolishing slavery
    00:31
    the 14th amendment does many things
    00:33
    which includes granted citizenship to
    00:36
    African Americans and defined
    00:37
    citizenship for future Americans and
    00:40
    also guaranteed equal protection under
    00:44
    the law and that's going to come into
    00:45
    play in this core case Plessy vs.
    00:47
    Ferguson and the 15th amendment provided
    00:49
    suffrage for African American males and
    00:52
    also we had Jim Crow laws that were
    00:54
    predominant in the south and these were
    00:56
    segregation laws and the south so this
    00:58
    legally required blacks and whites to be
    01:01
    segregated or separated in in the south
    01:04
    ok let's talk about who Homer Plessy is
    01:07
    and let's start with the Citizens
    01:09
    Committee this is a civil rights group
    01:11
    in the south and they wanted to attack
    01:14
    or challenge segregation laws in
    01:17
    Louisiana and this whole court case
    01:18
    really begins in New Orleans of
    01:20
    Louisiana and they wanted to
    01:22
    specifically attack the separate car act
    01:24
    which required equal but separate train
    01:27
    cars for blacks and whites so if you
    01:30
    were black you could not sit in the
    01:32
    white section of a train in the South
    01:35
    specifically Louisiana so Homer Plessy
    01:38
    here is Homer he is biracial and he
    01:41
    lived in Louisiana so he was picked to
    01:43
    specifically challenge this separate car
    01:46
    act and he is arrested for sitting in
    01:49
    the first-class section of a white train
    01:51
    cart if you go to New Orleans there
    01:54
    right in New Orleans in 2009 this plaque
    01:56
    was put up where the train station was
    01:59
    that Homer Plessy got on which started
    02:01
    the whole Corps case Plessy versus
    02:03
    Ferguson okay so it goes
    02:07
    Supreme Court Plessy and the Citizens
    02:10
    Committee challenges us and says this is
    02:11
    unfair in Plessy suit citing the
    02:14
    Fourteenth Amendment which states no
    02:16
    State shall make or enforce any law
    02:19
    which shall abridge the privileges or
    02:22
    immunities of citizens of the United
    02:25
    States so it's basically saying you
    02:26
    can't make any law it takes away
    02:28
    people's rights
    02:28
    that is what plus he's arguing Louisiana
    02:32
    judge ruled that the state could in fact
    02:34
    regulate railroads within the state as
    02:36
    long as the cars were separate but equal
    02:40
    so it's appealed all the way to the
    02:41
    Supreme Court in the Supreme Court in a
    02:43
    seven to one decision cited against
    02:46
    Plessy against Homer Plessy and they
    02:49
    cited for Louisiana and upheld that
    02:52
    issue of separate but equal now the one
    02:55
    lone dissenter was a justice by the name
    02:58
    of John Marshall Harlan boy this guy
    03:00
    wasn't destined to be a justice on the
    03:02
    Supreme Court his name is John Marshall
    03:04
    for cryin out loud and here's what he
    03:06
    said in view of the Constitution in the
    03:09
    eye of the law there is in this country
    03:12
    no superior dominant ruling class of
    03:15
    citizens there is no caste here our
    03:18
    Constitution is colorblind and neither
    03:20
    knows nor tolerates classes among
    03:22
    citizens in respective civil rights all
    03:25
    citizens are equal before the law he was
    03:28
    the only one in the Supreme Court that
    03:30
    disagreed or went against this decision
    03:33
    he was a man ahead of his time for sure
    03:35
    so what are the effects of this court
    03:38
    case well Jim Crow laws are now
    03:40
    officially upheld by the Supreme Court
    03:42
    and this doctrine of separate but equal
    03:46
    will remain in effect for 58 years until
    03:49
    1954 with the core case Brown versus the
    03:52
    Board of Education which I will do video
    03:54
    on you please make sure to check that
    03:56
    out as well and you will see this all
    03:58
    throughout this out that there are these
    03:59
    separate facilities for whites and
    04:01
    blacks and these facilities would be
    04:03
    labeled as color waiting rooms colored
    04:05
    drinking fountains color bathrooms you
    04:08
    name it there were separate facilities
    04:09
    and would be illegal for an African
    04:12
    American to use a white facility and in
    04:15
    reality of course these separate
    04:16
    facilities were not equal here's a
    04:18
    cartoon from 1904 by John
    04:21
    touch'n who kind of satirized how these
    04:24
    facilities are not equal whatsoever you
    04:26
    see a car for white folks which is very
    04:28
    nice and then a Jim Crow car which is
    04:30
    crumpled up and looks pretty beat-up
    04:33
    Plessy vs. Ferguson was finally
    04:36
    overturned in 1954 in 1964 was extended
    04:39
    even further 1954 Brown versus the Board
    04:42
    of Education in 1964 Civil Rights Act of
    04:46
    1964 which makes segregation ill legal
    04:49
    all right thank you very much for

    00:15
    covering in this video alright so let's
    00:18
    do a little intro to what the frontier
    00:20
    is so let's figure out what exactly it
    00:22
    is well it's a line that separated east
    00:25
    and west or civilization from wilderness
    00:28
    and it's important to note that
    00:30
    throughout American history this line
    00:32
    constantly shifted it was it was not a
    00:34
    line that Stood Still this was something
    00:36
    that was fluid and continued to move as
    00:38
    time went on and it often shifted
    00:40
    further and further west so for example
    00:43
    at one time in United States history
    00:45
    the frontier was this line that followed
    00:48
    the Appalachian Mountains over the
    00:49
    proclamation line of 1763 this could
    00:52
    have been said to have been the frontier
    00:53
    at one point so everything to the west
    00:56
    of this was wilderness or unexplored
    00:58
    area if we look at this next map by 1860
    01:02
    which is all these little dots here the
    01:05
    frontier is kind of in the middle of the
    01:06
    country so there's all this unexplored
    01:08
    land out here so it's really where east
    01:10
    meets west keep that in mind and this is
    01:12
    something that is fluid and moves
    01:14
    throughout time so why is it so
    01:17
    important while many Americans viewed
    01:19
    the frontier as an opportunity
    01:21
    particularly an economic opportunity for
    01:23
    that this goes along with something
    01:25
    called the safety valve theory and what
    01:27
    this states is that people it was this
    01:29
    belief that people could always move to
    01:31
    the frontier in times of economic crises
    01:33
    so if you're living in the city if you
    01:36
    get laid off from your job and in the
    01:38
    factory or wherever it may be there is
    01:40
    always this belief that you could just
    01:41
    pack up and move out west and you could
    01:43
    farm and then experience lots of
    01:45
    economic opportunities out west in
    01:48
    reality most people did not at 8 did not
    01:51
    take advantage of the frontier but the
    01:53
    idea this represented
    01:55
    optimism for people and hope for better
    01:57
    times if need be
    01:59
    so it's flash forward to 1890 this is a
    02:02
    very very important year in the frontier
    02:04
    history and we have the census to keep
    02:06
    in mind the census is taken every 10
    02:08
    years every year that ends it is zero
    02:10
    and is helped to determine the
    02:11
    population of the
    02:13
    country for the first time in United
    02:15
    States history in 1890 a frontier line
    02:17
    was no longer visible let's take a look
    02:19
    at another map here by 1860 all the red
    02:22
    was settled by 1870 all this orange was
    02:27
    who you see it expanding more and more
    02:29
    by 1880 is this yellow and by 1890 is
    02:33
    the green so if you look at this map by
    02:34
    1890 really there's not a lot of areas
    02:37
    as left to be unsettled most of this
    02:39
    area is probably desert or not arable or
    02:43
    good land to farm on so by 1890 the
    02:45
    frontier is essentially gone the US
    02:47
    Census Department reports so what
    02:50
    contributed to the decline in the
    02:51
    frontier while there was mass migration
    02:53
    out west in part due to gold rushes and
    02:57
    the Homestead Act of 1862 which offered
    02:59
    free or reduced land for settlers to
    03:02
    move out west and improve the land so in
    03:05
    1893 three years later we have a very
    03:08
    important thesis and it's titled the
    03:10
    significance of the frontier in American
    03:12
    history written by this guy Frederick
    03:15
    Jackson Turner that is yet another sweet
    03:18
    mustache look at the length coming off
    03:20
    of that if you'll notice have an
    03:21
    obsession with mustaches and this is a
    03:25
    pretty good one so the main idea the
    03:28
    writing the end of the frontier ended a
    03:30
    unique era in US history is what mr.
    03:33
    Turner argued and here's a quote from
    03:35
    his writing it says up to our own day
    03:38
    American history has been a large degree
    03:41
    in the history of the colonization of
    03:43
    the Great West the existence of an area
    03:46
    of free land it's continuous recession
    03:50
    in the advance of American settlement
    03:52
    westward explain American development so
    03:56
    in other words the frontier really
    03:58
    according to him helped contribute to
    04:00
    the American identity and this helped
    04:02
    make American society different from
    04:04
    Europe this is why American identity was
    04:06
    so much different from European
    04:08
    countries so what's the impact of the
    04:10
    end of the frontier now that it's over
    04:12
    many historians argue that the closing
    04:14
    of the frontier helped lead to overseas
    04:17
    expansion and again in 1890 the frontier
    04:19
    is over please know that it's closed and
    04:21
    two areas that we'll see the United
    04:23
    States expand into are Asia in the
    04:26
    Caribbean so if you were to ever see a
    04:28
    an essay about why the US expanded
    04:31
    overseas and began developing a policy
    04:34
    of imperialism there's many reasons for
    04:36
    that and I'll do a video on that later
    04:37
    but you can really argue that it began
    04:39
    that now that the United States the
    04:42
    frontier ended and all the land is
    04:43
    essentially taken people wanted to look
    04:45
    outside the continental United States
    04:47
    and also unfortunately for Native
    04:50
    Americans most of their land much of
    04:52
    their land they lost this is around the
    04:54
    time that we'll start to see Native
    04:55
    Americans be put on reservations and
    04:57
    they'll have less and less land
    04:59
    available to them all right that's it
    05:01
    for me in the frontier thank you very
    05:02

    00:01
    what's going on history peeps we have a
    00:03
    review video for you today I'm Booker T
    00:06
    Washington and w e be Dubois two very
    00:09
    influential african-americans from the
    00:11
    late 19th early 20th centuries
    00:14
    well that's gay going alright little
    00:16
    background on Booker T Washington he was
    00:18
    born in Virginia in 1856 as a slave so
    00:22
    he would not see emancipation through
    00:24
    the Thirteenth Amendment for many many
    00:27
    years later he established a Tuskegee
    00:29
    Institute in Alabama and here's a
    00:31
    picture of his a college for
    00:33
    african-americans and there is a house
    00:36
    that he lived in for most of his adult
    00:38
    life at the Tuskegee Institute this
    00:40
    house is still there you could go visit
    00:42
    it in Alabama he believed very shortly
    00:45
    that education was very important for
    00:47
    African Americans especially be able to
    00:49
    identify this vocational training this
    00:52
    is learning a specific school skill
    00:55
    today might be like being a plumber or
    00:57
    an electrician but it is learning a
    00:59
    specific skill and that's what he
    01:00
    encouraged African Americans to study
    01:02
    that type of education vocational in
    01:06
    1895 he gave a very famous speech called
    01:08
    the Atlanta compromise in which
    01:10
    expressed his belief that African
    01:12
    Americans should accept segregation
    01:14
    remember this is in the south this is
    01:15
    right in the heart of the Jim Crow era
    01:18
    in which African Americans and whites
    01:20
    were segregated and he argued that
    01:22
    African Americans should accept that
    01:24
    segregation in exchange for economic
    01:26
    opportunity so he saw this more as a
    01:28
    gradual thing in which African Americans
    01:31
    would eventually gain equality but in
    01:33
    the meantime just focus on economic
    01:35
    opportunities they need a very famous
    01:37
    quote it said in all things that are
    01:39
    purely social we could be as separate as
    01:42
    the finger so when it comes to socially
    01:43
    when it comes to segregation
    01:46
    african-americans of whites could be
    01:47
    separate yet one as the head in all
    01:50
    things essential to mutual progress so
    01:52
    as a cut when it comes to economic
    01:54
    opportunities definitely be familiar
    01:56
    with the Atlanta compromise and that
    01:58
    quote there please w eb Du Bois well he
    02:02
    was born in 1868 in Massachusetts so he
    02:05
    was born twelve years later and he was
    02:07
    born in the north so he never was born
    02:09
    as late he didn't know slavery slavery
    02:11
    was alley
    02:12
    go buy this plate so he's going to have
    02:13
    a much different life experience than
    02:16
    Booker T Washington did he received a
    02:19
    doctorate from Harvard he was the first
    02:21
    african-american to get his ph.d and he
    02:24
    a post Booker T Washington's
    02:27
    accommodation policies he was against
    02:29
    his ideas that blacks should accept
    02:32
    segregation in 1905 he was a very
    02:35
    important member of the Niagara movement
    02:37
    to see him right in the center here in
    02:39
    this picture this happened in Niagara
    02:41
    Falls Canada not Niagara Falls in New
    02:43
    York because hotels would not allow them
    02:45
    to stay so the golden Agri movement was
    02:47
    to end discrimination and segregation in
    02:50
    the United States
    02:51
    this helps morph into a couple years
    02:53
    later the n-double-a-cp or the National
    02:55
    Association for the Advancement of
    02:57
    Colored People and the goal of this
    02:59
    organization which is still around today
    03:01
    is to ensure equality and to end
    03:03
    discrimination as well w e be to believe
    03:06
    that something called the talented tenth
    03:08
    which we very well may see on any exam
    03:10
    and this is the belief that leaders in
    03:12
    the african-american community should
    03:14
    have full access to education in
    03:16
    American life so he didn't necessarily
    03:18
    believe in the vocational training that
    03:20
    Booker T believed in he believed that
    03:23
    African Americans should be able to to
    03:25
    pursue any education that they wish
    03:27
    including getting a doctorate as he did
    03:30
    from Harvard alright let's compare the
    03:33
    two individuals both wanted rights for
    03:35
    african-americans and again they were as
    03:37
    I said the beginning of the video they
    03:38
    were two of the most influential if not
    03:40
    the most influential african-americans
    03:42
    from the late 19th and early 20th
    03:44
    centuries and they differed on how to
    03:47
    achieve those rights again w EB was
    03:50
    against accommodation and segregation
    03:52
    Booker T was in favor of gradual
    03:55
    acceptance for African Americans he
    03:57
    realized this would not be won overnight
    03:58
    so it may take a little while whereas w
    04:01
    eb wanted immediate acceptance okay some
    04:04
    test tips for these two individuals as
    04:06
    you very well may see them if it's an
    04:08
    essay topic i chances are you won't see
    04:11
    them comparing you won't see a topic
    04:13
    comparing Booker T and W and B rather
    04:16
    what you'll see is comparing these two
    04:18
    individuals with other leaders from
    04:20
    different types so for example how to
    04:23
    Booker T W EB Dubois compared to
    04:26
    Martin Luther King and Malcolm X in the
    04:27
    1950s and the 1960s will kind of be the
    04:30
    two of them compared to two other
    04:33
    individuals from another time multiple
    04:36
    choice question tips when you see Booker
    04:38
    T thank vocational training and
    04:40
    definitely be able to identify that
    04:42
    quote and all things that are purely
    04:44
    social we could be as separate as the
    04:45
    fingers that was part of his Atlanta
    04:48
    compromise speech again accepting
    04:49
    segregation as long as you have economic
    04:52
    opportunities for W EB definitely know
    04:55
    the N double ACP know the Nagre movement
    04:57
    and know the talented tenth I mean it's
    04:59
    pretty much knowing everything in this
    05:00
    video but it's key word association
    05:02
    there to help you out with your test and
    05:05
    also good luck you'll do great you're

    the revised edition the most up-to-date
    00:09
    edition for the a push curriculum all
    00:13
    right let's start off with key concepts
    00:15
    seven point one it states growth
    00:17
    expanded opportunity while economic
    00:19
    instability led to new efforts to reform
    00:21
    u.s. society and its economic system
    00:24
    that's straight from page 68 and let's
    00:26
    take a look at some big idea questions
    00:28
    you should be able to answer number one
    00:30
    why did the u.s. transform from a rural
    00:32
    to industrial society and how did this
    00:34
    affect the lives of women and other
    00:36
    Americans
    00:36
    why did citizens and government
    00:38
    officials call for increased
    00:40
    intervention in the economy hint it'll
    00:42
    be the Great Depression and how did the
    00:44
    New Deal change through the relationship
    00:46
    between the government and the economy
    00:48
    and that to me sounds like a very good
    00:50
    short answer question or s a question
    00:53
    about the changing role of the federal
    00:56
    government alright let's take a look at
    00:58
    Roman numeral one it states the United
    01:00
    States continued its transition from a
    01:02
    rural agricultural economy to an urban
    01:04
    industrial economy led by large
    01:07
    corporations so some new technologies of
    01:10
    manufacturing techniques you should be
    01:12
    familiar with we have things like the
    01:13
    assembly line during the 19-teens in the
    01:15
    1920s this was really popularized by
    01:18
    Henry Ford and utilizing Taylorism or
    01:21
    this idea of time tasks and workers
    01:23
    would have the same repetitive tasks
    01:26
    over and over and over again a really
    01:28
    increased efficiency for products and
    01:30
    there was a huge focus on production of
    01:33
    consumer goods things like radios
    01:34
    refrigerators cars the Model T etc
    01:37
    during this time so what is impact of
    01:41
    these new goods while we have an
    01:42
    improved standard of living
    01:43
    we've greater personal mobility due to
    01:45
    cars most people prior to the invention
    01:47
    of the car really never traveled beyond
    01:49
    about 55 miles from where they were born
    01:52
    now they could travel all across the
    01:53
    country you have increased vacations and
    01:55
    new businesses even popping up across
    01:58
    the country and we also have better
    02:00
    communication systems things like phones
    02:02
    and radios which will become very
    02:04
    popular in the 1920s and forward so the
    02:07
    US will transform from a rural to an
    02:09
    urban society in 1920 that's the first
    02:12
    year in history that there are more
    02:13
    people living in cities than in rural
    02:16
    areas and this provided opportunities
    02:18
    for many different Americans you have
    02:20
    women who are working in factories at
    02:22
    places like the Triangle Shirtwaist
    02:23
    Factory in New York City which sadly
    02:26
    caught fire and here is a picture of
    02:27
    that the women had women began to work
    02:30
    outside the home of very large numbers
    02:32
    usually in textile factories
    02:34
    international migrants these are your
    02:36
    new immigrants that are coming over from
    02:38
    Southern and Eastern Europe and they're
    02:40
    moving to cities to work in factories
    02:41
    and you also have internal migrants and
    02:44
    we'll talk about this more in the next
    02:45
    key concept African Americans are moving
    02:47
    north as well as farmers are moving from
    02:49
    the south to the north to work in cities
    02:52
    and this movement of African Americans
    02:53
    to the north from the south
    02:55
    this is called the great migration which
    02:57
    we'll talk about more in the next key
    02:58
    concept
    03:00
    okay so economic downturns led to calls
    03:03
    for government involvement the creation
    03:05
    of a stronger financial regulatory
    03:06
    system so as a result of the Great
    03:08
    Depression people are going to begin to
    03:10
    call in larger numbers for government
    03:13
    intervention in the economy we have
    03:14
    things like the FDIC or the Federal
    03:16
    Deposit Insurance Corporation this was
    03:18
    created by FDR one of his first programs
    03:21
    to insure bank deposits so if a bank
    03:23
    went bankrupt your money would not and
    03:25
    this drastically decrease the number of
    03:27
    bank failures that the US was facing
    03:30
    especially in early on in FDR's
    03:32
    presidency which happened to be his
    03:34
    first year in 1933 the same year the
    03:37
    FDIC was created okay Roman numeral two
    03:39
    states in the Progressive Era of the
    03:41
    early 20th century progressives
    03:42
    responded to political corruption
    03:44
    economic instability and social concerns
    03:47
    by calling for greater government action
    03:49
    and other political and social measures
    03:52
    so a Progressive Era journalists
    03:54
    sometimes called muckrakers a term that
    03:56
    was coined by Teddy Roosevelt and they
    03:58
    attacked political corruption people
    04:01
    like Lincoln Steffens wrote a book
    04:03
    called the shame of cities and this
    04:04
    exposed corruption between municipal or
    04:06
    city government and businesses can't
    04:09
    talk about the Progressive Era without
    04:11
    talking about Jacob Riis and how the
    04:12
    other half lives his book focused on
    04:14
    poor people living in tenements in New
    04:16
    York City and this was really about
    04:17
    social injustice and economic inequality
    04:20
    and then when we're talking about
    04:22
    progressive error reformers who most
    04:24
    often happen to be middle class in
    04:25
    living in cities and certainly women
    04:27
    you have to know that they saw social
    04:28
    changes in cities and immigrant
    04:30
    populations and you know who this is
    04:32
    going to be you know it absolutely Jane
    04:34
    Addams and the whole house this was a
    04:36
    settlement house specifically aimed at
    04:38
    women and immigrants in large cities
    04:41
    this was founded in Chicago and other
    04:43
    settlement houses and Hall houses popped
    04:45
    up throughout the country on the
    04:46
    national level progressives sought to
    04:48
    regulate the economy you see the Clayton
    04:49
    Antitrust Act this will strengthen the
    04:52
    Sherman Antitrust Act and will allow the
    04:53
    government more power and breaking up
    04:56
    trusts or monopolies this also exempted
    04:59
    labor unions from prosecution also the
    05:01
    Federal Reserve Bank is created under
    05:03
    Woodrow Wilson's presidency in the
    05:04
    19-teens and this Bank was established
    05:07
    to control the money supply and it's
    05:09
    still around today more than a hundred
    05:11
    years later progressives sought to
    05:12
    expand democracy you see this with the
    05:14
    17th amendment there the direct election
    05:16
    of senators and this occurred because
    05:18
    senators used to be elected by state
    05:21
    legislatures and there weren't many
    05:23
    calls that the Senate was corrupt by
    05:27
    trust and you see here a very famous
    05:30
    political cartoon from PUC magazine you
    05:32
    have the steel beam trust you have the
    05:33
    copper trust Standard Oil Trust and it
    05:36
    says trust of the Senate's when you look
    05:38
    at this and the title down here in the
    05:39
    bottom says the bosses of the Senate
    05:41
    it's not the Senators it is the trust so
    05:44
    one way to limit that people thought was
    05:47
    allow for the direct election of
    05:48
    senators and allow citizens to vote on
    05:51
    the senators progressives also sought to
    05:53
    generate moral reform you see them the
    05:56
    18th amendment of 1919 which create a
    05:58
    prohibition which banned alcohol other
    06:00
    progressive constitutional amendments
    06:02
    that you should be familiar with the
    06:04
    16th created an income tax I remember
    06:06
    this because six has an axe in it as
    06:08
    does tax then the 19th amendment really
    06:11
    signifies the end of the Progressive Era
    06:13
    1920 this is women's suffrage so now all
    06:16
    adult citizens in the u.s. can vote we
    06:19
    have preservation as in conservation as
    06:21
    to terms you should be familiar with
    06:22
    during the Progressive Era and they both
    06:25
    advocated the establishment or favored
    06:28
    the establishment of national parks but
    06:30
    their responses to the overuse of
    06:33
    resources were different conservation is
    06:36
    people like Teddy Roosevelt who if he
    06:37
    were to turn around would could look
    06:39
    down 3,000 feet very high
    06:41
    they will advocate the proper use of
    06:43
    nature so Teddy Roosevelt ate that
    06:45
    people should be able to enjoy nature as
    06:47
    long as they're not over using it
    06:49
    preservation is on the other hand they
    06:51
    wanted complete protection of nature
    06:53
    from you so preservationist did not want
    06:55
    anybody to use nature whereas
    06:57
    conservationists want people to be able
    06:59
    to use nature as long as they didn't
    07:01
    overuse it there were some issues that
    07:03
    divided progressives including
    07:05
    segregation you have people like WEP
    07:07
    Dubois he was one of the cofounders of
    07:09
    the n-double a-c-p which emerged out of
    07:11
    the Niagara movement they sought to end
    07:13
    segregation and do so immediately on the
    07:16
    other end you have Booker T Washington
    07:17
    he's wanted more economic equality first
    07:20
    I do have a video on both of these guys
    07:21
    we also have expanding popular
    07:23
    participation in government some
    07:25
    progressives thought you know what it's
    07:27
    best for the educated and the
    07:28
    professionals to make decisions others
    07:30
    said you know what it's better for broad
    07:32
    political participation and immigration
    07:35
    divided progressives their disagreements
    07:39
    over restriction of immigration and we
    07:40
    will not see restriction on immigration
    07:42
    until the 1920s that will be in the next
    07:45
    key concept video all right we'll finish
    07:47
    up with Roman numeral three during the
    07:48
    1930s policymakers responded to the mass
    07:51
    unemployment social upheavals of the
    07:53
    Great Depression by transforming the
    07:55
    u.s. into a limited welfare state that
    07:57
    means that the government is involved in
    07:59
    helping people redefining the goals and
    08:02
    ideas of modern American liberalism so
    08:05
    FDR's New Deal he tried to end the
    08:07
    depression in the following ways using
    08:09
    the government to provide relief to the
    08:11
    poor there's going to be three hours the
    08:13
    first R is relief and he would do this
    08:15
    by providing jobs and help you will see
    08:18
    things like Social Security which will
    08:20
    provide income for elderly Americans I
    08:22
    really hope John Doe doesn't mind that
    08:24
    I'm showing you Social Security number
    08:26
    the AAA paid farmers to not over produce
    08:29
    crops those paid farmers not to grow
    08:31
    because one of the problems for farmers
    08:33
    was that the price of crops was so low
    08:36
    because they were producing so much FDR
    08:39
    also saw to stimulate recovery so the
    08:41
    second R is going to be recovery so we
    08:43
    have things like the Civilian
    08:44
    Conservation Corps in the PWA the
    08:46
    project works administration has put
    08:48
    people to work working outside building
    08:50
    infrastructure etc and after you're
    08:53
    embraced King
    08:54
    in deficit spending John Maynard Keynes
    08:57
    was a very famous economist and he said
    08:59
    in times of economic downturn the
    09:01
    government needs to spend money to prime
    09:04
    the pump or stimulate the economy they
    09:06
    need to spend more than they have that's
    09:08
    deficit and FDR embraced this and
    09:10
    finally the third are is reforming the
    09:13
    economy so this doesn't happen again
    09:15
    things like the Securities and Exchange
    09:16
    Commission which was established to
    09:19
    regulate the stock market and prevent
    09:21
    fraud and we also mentioned earlier the
    09:23
    FDIC which insured bank deposits that's
    09:26
    another example of a reform there were
    09:30
    movements that pushed for more reform
    09:32
    some people argued that FDR didn't go
    09:34
    far enough and we see this to unions
    09:35
    populist and radical so Huey Long he was
    09:38
    a governor from Louisiana and his
    09:41
    program proposed giving $5,000 to
    09:44
    citizens that families by taxing the
    09:46
    wealthy so he said one way to help out
    09:48
    is to tax the rich and then redistribute
    09:50
    that wealth to the poor or families or
    09:53
    those in need father Charles Coughlin he
    09:56
    was a very famous radio host he argued
    09:58
    that the government should nationalize
    09:59
    or own the bank so he said FDR didn't go
    10:02
    far enough
    10:02
    and some in Congress and the Supreme
    10:04
    Court were like you know what New Deal
    10:06
    you're getting a little too strong for
    10:07
    our liking so we're going to try to
    10:09
    limit it in Congress we have Robert Taft
    10:11
    who is the president former president
    10:13
    William Howard Taft son we'll come back
    10:14
    to him after World War two in the 1940s
    10:18
    and 50s he and other conservatives
    10:20
    wanted to stop the New Deal they felt it
    10:22
    was too socialist the government was
    10:24
    like too involved and the Supreme Court
    10:27
    is well tried to limit the scope of the
    10:30
    New Deal we see this with Schechter
    10:32
    poultry versus the US which overturned
    10:34
    the program that enha the NRA and also
    10:36
    US vs. Butler which overturned the AAA
    10:39
    if you want more info on the New Deal
    10:42
    please check out my video in the
    10:44
    description lots of info for you so
    10:47
    what's the legacy of the New Deal it did
    10:49
    not solely and the Great Depression
    10:51
    that's really going to be World War two
    10:52
    that does we do see new reforms and
    10:55
    agencies that are still around today as
    10:56
    I mentioned the Social Security the FHA
    10:59
    which is the Federal Housing
    11:00
    Administration they provide mortgage
    11:01
    loans FDIC etc there is a change in
    11:05
    voting pattern so this is start I can't
    11:07
    stress enough you need to know this
    11:08
    very very very important
    11:10
    african-americans switch from the
    11:12
    Republican Party to the Democratic Party
    11:15
    in very large numbers for a very long
    11:18
    time african-americans voted Republican
    11:20
    because of Abe Lincoln during the Great
    11:22
    Depression they will switch to the
    11:24
    Democratic Party because they will get
    11:26
    jobs and relief from the New Deal and we
    11:30
    also see many ethnic groups beginning to
    11:32
    identify with the Democrats and
    11:33
    working-class communities or labor
    11:36
    unions this guy's the change in voting
    11:39
    patterns is specifically mentioned in
    11:41
    the new curriculum make sure you know it
    11:43
    all right so let's finish up with
    11:45
    subtests tips for multiple choices short
    11:46
    answer identify and explain
    11:48
    opportunities for women
    11:49
    african-americans and immigrants and
    11:51
    cities why are they moving to cities
    11:53
    what are some successes failures and
    11:55
    critics of the New Deal and government
    11:57
    reforms during the Great Depression be
    11:59
    able to identify and explain some of
    12:00
    those programs for essay questions you
    12:03
    can see comparing and contrasting
    12:04
    government response during the Great
    12:06
    Depression two other time periods such
    12:08
    as the Progressive Era that's something
    12:09
    I'm going to be reviewing with my
    12:11
    students because that's very important
    12:13
    in a great potential essay topic and
    12:14
    causes and effects of various migrations

    12:19
    migration and international such as new

    key concept econ sep 7 2014 2 internal
    00:45
    and international migration patterns so
    00:48
    some big idea questions you should be
    00:50
    able to answer are how did technology
    00:52
    transform the standard of living in the
    00:54
    United States what factors led to
    00:56
    immigration restrictions during the
    00:58
    1920s and what caused the internal
    01:01
    migration to increased drastically in
    01:03
    the United States during the first half
    01:04
    of the 20th century let's go over to
    01:07
    Roman numeral 1 it states popular
    01:09
    culture grew in influence in u.s.
    01:10
    society even as debates increased over
    01:13
    the effects of culture on public values
    01:16
    morals and American national identity so
    01:19
    during the 1920s we especially we have
    01:22
    new mass media that helps spread culture
    01:24
    and awareness of regional cultures we
    01:26
    have things like the radio which is very
    01:28
    very popular this is a large source of
    01:30
    entertainment whether it is through war
    01:33
    the worlds in 1938 fireside chats during
    01:36
    the Great Depression with FDR in which
    01:38
    he would talk about how it did the
    01:39
    Academy is safe and Americans should put
    01:41
    their money back in banks or the very
    01:43
    popular radio shows of father Charles
    01:46
    Coughlin during the Great Depression
    01:47
    cinema is very popular during the 1920s
    01:49
    we have Nickelodeon's which were these
    01:51
    nickel movies and movies entertain money
    01:54
    during the Great Depression and in 1927
    01:57
    we have the jazz singer which is the
    01:59
    first movie with sound regional cultures
    02:02
    have developed her in this time
    02:04
    Yiddish theater portrayed experiences of
    02:06
    American Jews and they would influence
    02:08
    english-speaking theaters later on in
    02:10
    America an Edward Hopper wrote about the
    02:13
    loan
    02:13
    of the modern city keep in mind in 1920
    02:16
    more people are living in cities than in
    02:19
    rural areas so we the Harlem Renaissance
    02:22
    during the 1920s huge part of American
    02:26
    history this is a celebration of African
    02:27
    American culture through writing music
    02:30
    and art and here's one of the most
    02:32
    famous members of the Harlem Renaissance
    02:34
    Langston Hughes in his poem that reads
    02:36
    the night is beautiful
    02:38
    so the faces of my people the stars are
    02:41
    beautiful so the eyes of my people
    02:42
    beautiful also is the Sun beautiful also
    02:46
    are the souls of my people so it was
    02:48
    really reinforcing the idea of
    02:50
    celebrating African American culture and
    02:53
    experiences as I just mentioned we have
    02:55
    lakes in here's we also absorb nearly
    02:57
    Hurston who was very popular during this
    02:59
    time as well there are restrictions on
    03:01
    freedom of speech during World War one
    03:03
    the Espionage Act of 1917 the Sedition
    03:06
    Act of 1918 or two examples of this that
    03:08
    made it illegal to criticize the war
    03:11
    effort and these restrictions on freedom
    03:13
    were upheld during the carcase Schenck
    03:14
    versus the United States States and what
    03:17
    Charles shank was convicted of
    03:19
    interfering with the war effort and the
    03:22
    Supreme Court said if you pose a clear
    03:24
    and present danger if your speech poses
    03:26
    a clear and present danger it is not
    03:28
    guaranteed well so the Red Scare which
    03:31
    is fears of radicalism communism and
    03:33
    anarchism and the impacts of this are
    03:36
    there going to be a tax on unions and
    03:37
    immigrants governor Calvin Coolidge he
    03:40
    stopped the Boston police strike in 1919
    03:43
    became very famous nationwide and that
    03:46
    actually helped catapult him to the vice
    03:48
    presidency of 1920 so let's talk about
    03:51
    some controversies and debates in the
    03:53
    1920s we have gender roles so flappers
    03:55
    these women challenged gender roles they
    03:57
    would drink and dance and smoked and
    03:59
    wear shorter dresses Margaret Sanger was
    04:01
    an advocate of birth control during this
    04:03
    time that was very controversial we have
    04:06
    issues of modernism again as I mentioned
    04:08
    the 1920 census more Americans are
    04:10
    living in cities for the first time and
    04:12
    many workers lost autonomy because of
    04:15
    the popularity of the assembly line so
    04:18
    workers became easily replaceable there
    04:21
    are conflicts between science and
    04:22
    religion look no further than the Scopes
    04:24
    trial for this this is
    04:26
    literal interpretation of the Bible
    04:28
    versus evolution John Scopes was put on
    04:30
    trial for teaching evolution in a public
    04:32
    school and there are race issues as well
    04:35
    in 1919 we have the red summer this has
    04:37
    nothing to do with communism most the
    04:39
    time when you see red think communism
    04:41
    but not the red summer these are race
    04:43
    riots in northern cities most notably
    04:44
    Chicago immigration as well is very
    04:48
    controversial during the 1920s who the
    04:49
    rise of nativism in the 1920s and the
    04:51
    resurgence of the KKK and of course
    04:54
    Sacco and Vanzetti two Italian
    04:56
    immigrants were charged and convicted of
    04:58
    murder in later sentenced to death in
    05:01
    the 1920s
    05:03
    okay key concepts 7.2 Roman numeral two
    05:06
    states economic pressures global events
    05:08
    and political developments called sharp
    05:10
    variations in the number sources and
    05:11
    experiences of both international
    05:14
    internal migrants so prior to World War
    05:16
    one European immigration reached its
    05:18
    zenith or its highest point and this
    05:20
    gave rise to nativism in the 1920s which
    05:23
    then gave rise to restrictive
    05:25
    immigration quotas so in 1921 we have
    05:28
    the emergency quota act which restricted
    05:30
    immigration to three percent of a
    05:32
    country's population in the US according
    05:35
    to the 1910 census only 3% of cording to
    05:38
    the 1910 census could come to the United
    05:41
    States well three years later Calvin
    05:44
    Coolidge the former governor of
    05:45
    Massachusetts signs the National Origins
    05:48
    Act of 1924 and this further restricted
    05:51
    immigration to 2% of a country's
    05:53
    population in the US and he used the
    05:55
    1890 census in stead and this also
    05:58
    flat-out excluded immigrants from Asia
    06:01
    so in addition to being restrictive to
    06:05
    targeting new immigrants from Southern
    06:07
    and Eastern Europe it also restrict
    06:09
    outright restricted immigrants from Asia
    06:11
    so are some reasons for internal
    06:14
    migration to cities or urban centers
    06:16
    World War one and World War two saw
    06:18
    economic opportunities and cities for
    06:20
    war production and labor during the
    06:24
    Great Depression the 1930s in particular
    06:26
    your people like the Okies who fled the
    06:27
    Dust Bowl to California because farming
    06:30
    was so dried up in the Great Plains many
    06:31
    people just pack their bags and moved
    06:33
    out to California and this is what the
    06:35
    book The Grapes of Wrath is about
    06:36
    the great migration started this circle
    06:39
    are going to highlight you have to know
    06:40
    it's very very important this occurs
    06:42
    during and after World War one this is
    06:44
    the movement of African Americans from
    06:46
    the south to the north and the West as
    06:49
    well you look at these cities with
    06:50
    Chicago New York those are in the north
    06:52
    and the cities like st. Louis and the
    06:54
    West and african-americans are moving in
    06:56
    large numbers to the north and west so
    06:59
    what are some reasons well they're
    07:00
    escaping segregation because of Plessy
    07:03
    versus Ferguson allowing for separate
    07:05
    but equal facilities are also escaping
    07:07
    racial violence whether it's from the
    07:09
    KKK or lynchings and there's also
    07:11
    limited economic opportunities because
    07:14
    many african-americans in the south were
    07:16
    sharecroppers so they're moving to the
    07:17
    north for economic opportunities but
    07:21
    they still face discrimination in the
    07:24
    north just as they did in the south ok
    07:28
    many Mexicans came to the US for
    07:30
    economic opportunities during this time
    07:32
    period and they faced ambivalent or
    07:34
    contradictory government policies in the
    07:36
    1930s in the 1940 so many of them about
    07:39
    500,000 were deported during the Great
    07:41
    Depression because there weren't enough
    07:43
    jobs to go around so the government
    07:44
    deported or sent out of the country many
    07:46
    Mexicans now during World War 2 the u.s.
    07:49
    instituted something called the bracero
    07:51
    program which is in which the u.s.
    07:53
    encouraged Mexican immigration during
    07:55
    World War Two as a labor source and many
    07:58
    of these Mexicans would work as farmers
    08:01
    to help out in producing goods for the
    08:03
    war effort I'll finish up with some
    08:06
    tested for multiple choices short answer
    08:07
    absolutely no changes in technology in
    08:10
    the 1920s things like the radio and
    08:12
    cinema causes of cultural and political
    08:13
    conflict the Harlem Renaissance
    08:15
    absolutely know that and the Red Scare
    08:17
    the impacts of it as well as the causes
    08:19
    the immigration acts they are
    08:20
    restrictive against southern in Eastern
    08:22
    Europe and flat-out barred Asian
    08:24
    immigrants the great migration this to
    08:26
    me screams a great short answer question
    08:28
    what were the causes and impacts and for
    08:31
    essay questions migration are
    08:33
    opportunities this could be part of a
    08:34
    larger essay in World War one and/or
    08:37
    World War two especially comparing and
    08:39
    contrasting World War one in World War
    08:40
    two and comparing the 1920s to another
    08:43
    decade for instance the 1950s they are
    08:46
    kind of similar
    08:47

    the United States into a position of
    00:53
    international power while renewing
    00:55
    domestic debates over the nation's
    00:58
    proper role in the world so it's a big
    01:01
    idea questions to focus on what were
    01:02
    arguments for and against US expansion
    01:05
    overseas in the late 19th early 20th
    01:07
    centuries that is screaming to me a
    01:09
    short answer question and I'll break it
    01:11
    down for you how did World War One in
    01:13
    World War two challenged the us's
    01:14
    tradition of neutrality and what ways
    01:16
    did the u.s. change its views and remain
    01:19
    the same that to me is a great compare
    01:22
    and contrast essay and what impacts did
    01:24
    World War two have on the homefront as
    01:26
    well as the u.s. position in the world
    01:29
    right in Roman numeral one states in the
    01:31
    late 19th century and early twentieth
    01:33
    century new u.s. territorial ambitions
    01:35
    and acquisitions in the Western
    01:38
    Hemisphere and the Pacific accompanied
    01:40
    heightened public debates over America's
    01:43
    role in the world so let's talk about
    01:45
    imperialist arguments to expand overseas
    01:48
    again late 1800s Early 1900s really in
    01:51
    the cusp of the spanish-american war an
    01:53
    imperialist serve those that are favor
    01:55
    of expansion argued for economic
    01:58
    opportunities and you have American
    02:00
    companies that saw overseas markets for
    02:03
    example in Hawaii when it was its own
    02:05
    country there were many US plantation
    02:08
    owners in Hawaii that called for
    02:09
    annexation
    02:10
    so they could be exempt from sugar
    02:12
    tariffs when they would ship their
    02:13
    to the United States there are also
    02:15
    racial theories the very famous poem the
    02:17
    white man's burden was published in 1899
    02:20
    and some people saw to civilize
    02:22
    non-white nations and this is an
    02:24
    argument that we've seen throughout US
    02:26
    history including when the Europeans
    02:29
    came to the Americas they sought to
    02:30
    civilize the Native Americans and also
    02:33
    the idea that the frontier was closed
    02:35
    and this is an idea that came about by
    02:37
    Frederick Jackson Turner he looked at
    02:39
    the 1890 census and he said listen the
    02:42
    frontier is essentially closed all the
    02:44
    land in the continental US has taken all
    02:46
    the good land at least and many people
    02:49
    saw that as an argument to expand
    02:51
    overseas be familiar with these three
    02:54
    topics again as I mentioned this screams
    02:56
    to me a short-answer question so let's
    02:59
    talk about arguments used by anti
    03:00
    imperialist
    03:01
    against this overseas acquisition you
    03:03
    have this idea of self-determination or
    03:05
    the idea that countries should choose
    03:07
    their own form of government and after
    03:10
    the u.s. acquired the Philippines after
    03:12
    spanish-american war you would hear
    03:14
    anti-imperialists asking the question
    03:16
    didn't these Filipinos deserve the
    03:18
    consent of the governed didn't they
    03:21
    deserve to choose their own government
    03:23
    much like America want to when they
    03:24
    broke away from Great Britain we also
    03:27
    have a tradition of isolationism going
    03:29
    back to George Washington's farewell
    03:30
    address stay out of the affairs of other
    03:33
    countries the spanish-american war in
    03:35
    1898 this saw the us defeat Spain in
    03:39
    four short months from April to August
    03:40
    of 1898 some causes are the destruction
    03:44
    of the USS Maine yellow journalism in
    03:46
    the Delon letter in which a Spanish
    03:48
    official criticized President McKinley
    03:50
    the u.s. wins this war the gain Guam
    03:53
    Cuba Puerto Rico in the Philippines and
    03:55
    Cuba will get independence almost
    03:58
    immediately and the Philippines will not
    04:00
    get independence until after World War
    04:02
    two so the effects of the war the US
    04:05
    presence in the Caribbean and Latin
    04:06
    America increased significantly
    04:08
    especially with the Roosevelt Corollary
    04:10
    in which Teddy Roosevelt's essentially
    04:12
    said you know what the u.s. is going to
    04:13
    be a police power in Latin America in
    04:16
    the Caribbean and the u.s. can increase
    04:18
    its presence there we also have the
    04:20
    emergence of a nationalist movement in
    04:21
    the Philippines led by emilio aguinaldo
    04:23
    he and many others thought that the US
    04:26
    would grant them into
    04:27
    penance and when they did not get
    04:29
    independence they began to rebel against
    04:31
    the United States if you want more info
    04:33
    on this and this is a great essay topic
    04:35
    as well see my video in the description
    04:37
    the spanish-american war as a turning
    04:40
    point Roman numeral two it states World
    04:42
    War one in its aftermath intensified
    04:44
    ongoing debates about the nation's role
    04:45
    in the world and how best to achieve
    04:47
    national security and pursue American
    04:50
    interests so initially in World War one
    04:52
    the US remained neutral now upon entry
    04:55
    the u.s. departed from the tradition of
    04:58
    non involvement in European affairs this
    05:00
    is the second time I'm mentioning
    05:01
    Washington's farewell address so if
    05:04
    you're writing an essay about World War
    05:05
    one or World War two as we will see your
    05:08
    synthesis point could be about
    05:10
    Washington's farewell address idea that
    05:12
    many people thought the US should not
    05:13
    get involved in this European war and
    05:16
    again in his farewell address Washington
    05:18
    said stay out of entangling alliances
    05:21
    Wilson called for humanitarian and
    05:23
    democratic principles this helped lead
    05:26
    the u.s. into war he said he wanted the
    05:27
    to fight in the war to make the world
    05:29
    safe for democracy and that was his
    05:32
    argument going against Washington's
    05:34
    farewell address and Woodrow Wilson put
    05:36
    fourteen ideas or points together in
    05:39
    which he envisioned that the world would
    05:40
    be safe for democracy it would be a war
    05:42
    to end all wars so there would never be
    05:44
    another war like World War one sadly he
    05:48
    was wrong so let's talk about the role
    05:49
    of the American Expeditionary Forces or
    05:51
    the military the u.s. entered the war in
    05:53
    1917 so they came a little more little
    05:56
    after halfway and the u.s. is entrance
    05:58
    really tipped the balance in favor of
    06:00
    the Allies of Great Britain of France
    06:02
    and Russia who had bowed out of the war
    06:05
    so the Senate after the end of World War
    06:08
    one they refused to ratify the Treaty of
    06:11
    Versailles or join the League of Nations
    06:13
    and the League of Nations was one of
    06:14
    Wilson's fourteen points so even though
    06:17
    Wilson was heavily involved in the post
    06:19
    war negotiations the Senate did not
    06:21
    ratify the League of Nations and this is
    06:24
    an example of checks and balances let's
    06:26
    talk about the Treaty of Versailles it
    06:28
    ended World War one in a punished
    06:29
    Germany severely the League of Nations
    06:32
    was created at the time and this was a
    06:35
    major component as I mentioned of
    06:37
    Wilson's fourteen points this was an
    06:39
    international
    06:40
    organization to hope to prevent Wars and
    06:43
    promote peace now we see this bridge
    06:44
    here and the centerpiece or the Keystone
    06:47
    the most important pieces of the United
    06:49
    States and it's missing so what's going
    06:50
    to happen in this bridge it will
    06:52
    collapse as the League of Nations does
    06:54
    fail so Henry Cabot Lodge he was a
    06:57
    senator and he and other irreconcilable
    06:58
    these were members of Congress that were
    07:01
    against the League of Nations the u.s.
    07:03
    joining the League of Nations and
    07:04
    Congress feared that they could lose
    07:06
    their war making power if the u.s.
    07:08
    joined the league and again I can't
    07:10
    stress this enough Washington's farewell
    07:12
    address is kind of hovering over
    07:13
    everybody at this time so the third time
    07:16
    imagine Washington's ghost and there you
    07:20
    go he disappeared like he was a ghost
    07:23
    whew so it's up by u.s. foreign policy
    07:25
    following World War one they pursued a
    07:28
    unilateral policy that used
    07:30
    international investment we see a
    07:32
    continuing of dollar diplomacy the idea
    07:35
    that US banks should invest in foreign
    07:37
    countries this was really under the
    07:39
    administration this began under the
    07:40
    administration of Taft we have some
    07:43
    peace treaties for example the
    07:45
    Washington Naval conference this was the
    07:47
    five power nine power treaties that
    07:49
    determined the number of battleships
    07:50
    that the US Britain and Japan could
    07:52
    build at a 5 to 5 to 3 ratio so for
    07:55
    every five tons the u.s. built Britain
    07:57
    could build five tons and Japan could
    07:59
    build three tons the u.s. did engage in
    08:01
    select military intervention most of
    08:04
    this was in Latin America for example in
    08:06
    Nicaragua between 1912 and 1933 the US
    08:09
    was involved and the u.s. did maintain
    08:11
    isolationism when it came to Europe in
    08:14
    particular the neutrality acts the first
    08:16
    neutrality acts the 1930s forbid trading
    08:19
    with warring or belligerent nations do
    08:21
    me a favor and make sure you know that
    08:23
    term belligerent that means countries
    08:24
    that are engaged in war and many
    08:26
    Americans oppose military action until
    08:29
    Pearl Harbor an example this is the
    08:31
    American 1st committee they were against
    08:33
    US intervention in world war ii and
    08:36
    europe and charles lindbergh here when
    08:37
    the most famous Americans at the time
    08:39
    and Senator Robert Taft they were people
    08:42
    who were against US intervention you see
    08:44
    Charles Lindbergh is giving a speech
    08:45
    Aaron who is over his left shoulder
    08:47
    that's George Washington reminding
    08:50
    people of his farewell address of
    08:52
    staying out of for
    08:53
    and affairs finish up of Roman numeral
    08:56
    three us participation in World War two
    08:58
    transformed American society while the
    09:00
    victory of the United States and its
    09:01
    allies over the Axis powers vaulted the
    09:04
    u.s. into a position of global political
    09:06
    and military leadership so how did
    09:10
    Americans view the war while they viewed
    09:12
    it as a fight for freedom and democracy
    09:14
    not just for American Europe but really
    09:17
    the world as a whole and this was later
    09:20
    reinforced by Japanese wartime
    09:21
    atrocities things like the Bataan Death
    09:23
    March in which Americans and Filipinos
    09:26
    were ordered to march many many miles to
    09:28
    camp and hundreds of them died along the
    09:31
    way you also if you've seen the movie or
    09:33
    read the book unbroken I read the book
    09:35
    and it was tremendous it's a true story
    09:37
    about an American soldier who was a
    09:40
    former Olympic athlete in the 1936
    09:42
    Olympics and he really endured just
    09:45
    horrific abuse by the Japanese and these
    09:49
    stories began to emerge at the
    09:50
    conclusion of World War two and of
    09:53
    course he of the Nazi concentration
    09:54
    camps in the Holocaust many many people
    09:57
    viewed World War two as a fight for
    09:59
    humanity and freedom we had the mass
    10:01
    mobilization of American society this
    10:04
    helped end the Great Depression it
    10:05
    wasn't the New Deal that really ended
    10:07
    the Great Depression it was really world
    10:08
    war two and an industrial base helped
    10:11
    win the war by providing equipment
    10:13
    provisions and troops for the war effort
    10:16
    millions and millions and millions of
    10:18
    Americans fought in the war and many
    10:20
    factories produced equipment and
    10:22
    provisions for the US and its allies so
    10:25
    the mobilization provided opportunities
    10:27
    for women and minorities women worked in
    10:30
    factories you have Rosie the Riveter you
    10:31
    know her and they worked in health care
    10:33
    during the war and there was many
    10:35
    opportunities for women due to World War
    10:36
    two african-americans served in the
    10:38
    military in large numbers although they
    10:40
    did serve in segregated units and they
    10:42
    worked in factories as well now World
    10:46
    War two help lead to debates over racial
    10:48
    segregation a philip Randolph a huge
    10:50
    civil rights activist he helped lead to
    10:53
    executive order 8802 in which FDR
    10:56
    eliminated discrimination in defense
    10:59
    industry so if you are a defense
    11:01
    industry during World War two you could
    11:03
    not have your employees discriminated a
    11:06
    fill
    11:07
    Randolph really pushed for that the
    11:09
    double V campaign stand stood for
    11:12
    victory over fascism abroad and victory
    11:14
    over racism at home so America on one
    11:17
    hand is fighting against fascism and
    11:19
    militarism in the world but there's
    11:21
    still racism at home and after the war
    11:23
    many Americans will begin to focus on
    11:25
    desegregation milt the military did
    11:29
    remain segregated until the Korean War
    11:30
    Truman will issue executive order 99-81
    11:34
    which will desegregate the military and
    11:37
    there are challenges to civil liberties
    11:39
    during this time because Japanese
    11:41
    internment this was the forest movement
    11:42
    of japanese-americans two camps during
    11:44
    the war to essentially prison camps
    11:46
    two-thirds of them were Nisei meaning
    11:48
    that they were born in America they were
    11:50
    Japanese descent but born in America
    11:52
    this was upheld by the court case
    11:54
    Korematsu versus the United States so
    11:58
    what were some reasons for the US and
    11:59
    Allied victory you had allied
    12:01
    cooperation the you a scraper in France
    12:03
    and the Soviet Union were close together
    12:04
    especially the US and Great Britain with
    12:06
    FDR and Winston Churchill at the Tehran
    12:09
    conference there was a meeting of the
    12:11
    big three which is FDR Churchill and
    12:14
    Stalin and they agreed here to invade
    12:17
    Europe in 1944 there are also technical
    12:20
    and scientific advancements things like
    12:22
    the Manhattan Project which provided two
    12:23
    billion dollars to develop the atomic
    12:25
    bomb here is Robert Oppenheimer one of
    12:28
    the main people on the Manhattan Project
    12:31
    and helped create the atomic bomb and
    12:33
    they are examining the Trinity test site
    12:37
    of the first atomic bomb now these the
    12:39
    use of atomic bombs quickly ended the
    12:41
    war but there they did spark debates
    12:44
    among the morality of the atomic bombs
    12:47
    we also have sonar this was used against
    12:49
    German submarines by American ships and
    12:51
    servicemen and women played a vital role
    12:53
    millions of Americans fought in the war
    12:55
    as I mentioned earlier and then they're
    12:57
    even campaigns such as island hopping in
    12:59
    which the US will conquer islands in the
    13:01
    Pacific prior to attacking Japan so they
    13:03
    would go from island to island and then
    13:05
    focused on Japan and then of course the
    13:08
    d-day invasion this was June 6 1944 led
    13:11
    by future President Dwight Eisenhower
    13:13
    here is the day before giving a speech
    13:16
    to the mat about what is to come the
    13:18
    next day and finally at the end of the
    13:20
    war the
    13:20
    besmirch is the most powerful nation on
    13:22
    earth and they did so because most of
    13:25
    Asia and Europe was really in ruins from
    13:27
    the war and the US had a dominant role
    13:30
    in the Allied victory and post-war peace
    13:32
    settlement so we have the creation of
    13:34
    the United Nations which is
    13:35
    headquartered in New York City and the
    13:37
    u.s. is a permanent member of the
    13:39
    Security Council so they could veto any
    13:41
    resolution and we also see a departure
    13:44
    from this moment forward from
    13:46
    Washington's farewell address he no
    13:48
    longer his idea of staying out Foreign
    13:51
    Affairs is no longer going to be
    13:53
    dominant in American society in
    13:55
    Washington's like by a push I'm finally
    13:57
    gone for good and somebody comes along
    14:00
    as like holy cow he's gone huh it's like
    14:03
    he was around in a push forever to get
    14:06
    it cuz Henry Clay was around forever
    14:07
    yeah okay I had to include Henry Clay
    14:10
    all right so some test steps for
    14:11
    multiple choice and short answer
    14:12
    arguments for and against expansion u.s.
    14:15
    expansion overseas know that that
    14:17
    screaming a short answer to me Treaty of
    14:19
    Versailles in the 14 point reasons for
    14:21
    victories in World War one in World War
    14:22
    two and what the heck was the domestic
    14:24
    impact of World War two on minorities on
    14:27
    the economy etc and women as well for
    14:29
    essays you can see comparing and
    14:30
    contrasting the USS role in the world
    14:33
    post-world War One and post World War
    14:35
    two your synthesis point will be
    14:37
    Washington's farewell address and social
    14:39
    impacts of World War two whether it's on
    14:41
    japanese-americans women or
    14:43
    african-americans all right guys look
    14:45
    forward to seeing back here four key
    14:47
    concept 8.1 when we will figure out who
    14:49
    this dude is here's a hint he's one of
    14:51
    the most influential people of the 20th
    14:53
    century yet most people have no idea who
    14:57
    he is so I thank you guys for watching
    14:59
    best of luck on all your tests
    15:01
    especially the one in May it'll be here
    15:03

    00:00
    hey what's going on a push peeps today
    00:02
    we have a video on conservation and
    00:04
    preservation during the Progressive Era
    00:07
    so we're talking about the environment a
    00:09
    very important topic that shows up in
    00:13
    the new curriculum and a great chance if
    00:15
    there's ever an essay on the environment
    00:17
    to make some connections across time
    00:20
    before I begin shout out time I think of
    00:22
    two shout outs to two very very
    00:24
    important classes I appreciate their
    00:26
    support so much we got mr. Burns's class
    00:29
    in a Warwick New York I had a teacher
    00:32
    mr. burns in high school but I'm not
    00:33
    from work and mr. Moe's class in Hilton
    00:37
    Head South Carolina
    00:38
    I've never been to Hilton Head but I've
    00:40
    been to nearby Kiawah Island in South
    00:43
    Carolina beautiful weather down there
    00:45
    thank you all for the support I
    00:46
    appreciate it
    00:47
    best of luck to you this year background
    00:50
    info for this topic what is conservation
    00:54
    well it's advocating the proper use of
    00:56
    natural resources an example I'm gonna
    01:00
    give you two examples of people that
    01:01
    fall into this category we got Teddy
    01:03
    Roosevelt's and we have Gifford Pinchot
    01:06
    too is Roosevelt's chief Forester and
    01:08
    mustache connoisseur and you can see the
    01:11
    two of them here together chillin on a
    01:13
    boat probably talking about the
    01:14
    environment
    01:15
    now preservation is advocating the
    01:18
    protection of nature and land from
    01:21
    humans so you're protecting nature from
    01:24
    humans think of dudes like this guy with
    01:27
    the sweet beard John you're in the
    01:29
    Sierra Club okay so what are some
    01:31
    similarities between the two groups well
    01:33
    both conservationist and preservationist
    01:36
    they advocated establishing national
    01:39
    parks they wanted the government to put
    01:41
    land aside and recognize them as
    01:43
    national parks the first national park
    01:46
    is Yellowstone in 1872 this is the first
    01:49
    federally created National Park and
    01:52
    apparently you could just like be tea
    01:54
    and lunch one day and bears will come up
    01:55
    and eat lunch with you at a table or
    01:57
    your car yeah that's completely normal I
    02:00
    would be freaked out Yosemite this is a
    02:03
    national park in California in 1890 and
    02:07
    here is Teddy Roosevelt on Mir chillin
    02:09
    on the edge of a mountain that's about
    02:10
    3,000 feet high yet not scary at all I
    02:12
    am incredibly
    02:13
    just looking at this and here is a tree
    02:17
    in Yosemite that you could walk through
    02:19
    and potentially even drive your car
    02:21
    through look at the size of that tree
    02:23
    huh that's magnificent
    02:24
    okay so now that we established these
    02:26
    similarities let's talk about
    02:27
    differences well conservationists
    02:30
    support using nature they do support
    02:33
    human interactions with nature look no
    02:35
    further than Teddy Roosevelt here with
    02:38
    his gun he was an active outdoorsman he
    02:40
    believed in hunting he believed in
    02:42
    chillin at parks when he was vice
    02:44
    president received the news that
    02:45
    President McKinley was very sick and
    02:47
    about to die he was chilling out in the
    02:49
    Adirondack Mountains or was it the
    02:52
    Appalachian one of the two in New York
    02:54
    State and he was just like having a good
    02:56
    time living it up out there when he got
    02:59
    the news preservationist they wanted to
    03:01
    protect nature from human interaction so
    03:04
    conservationists are okay with using
    03:06
    nature and interacting with it
    03:07
    preservationist don't want really any of
    03:09
    that at all now an example that shows
    03:13
    the debates between these two groups is
    03:15
    the Hetch Hetchy controversy hitachi is
    03:18
    an area of land in Yosemite National
    03:20
    Park San Francisco in California about
    03:24
    167 miles away you'll see in a few
    03:26
    minutes they sought a stable water
    03:29
    supply so they proposed to build a dam
    03:31
    in this head hatch Hetchy area of
    03:34
    Yosemite and then you know get some
    03:37
    fancy aqueducts next thing you know they
    03:38
    got water coming to San Francisco Wow
    03:41
    John Muir again the Sierra Club founder
    03:43
    and preservationist he greatly greatly
    03:46
    opposed the dam he was outspoken against
    03:49
    it because he's a preservation as he did
    03:51
    not want the land to be touched at all
    03:53
    however Pinchot and then ultimately
    03:55
    Roosevelt as Roosevelt appointed Pinchot
    03:58
    to decide this he approved the
    04:00
    construction of the dam and he
    04:02
    essentially said something along lines
    04:04
    of the needs of the people outranked
    04:07
    preservation so these cities a city of
    04:09
    San Francisco the city that is
    04:10
    burgeoning becoming very powerful out
    04:12
    west very big they need water and that
    04:16
    dam that would help defer water to them
    04:18
    was acceptable according to him fun fact
    04:22
    today 85 percent of water usage in San
    04:25
    Francisco comes from Hetch
    04:27
    gee 167 miles away so 400 years later
    04:31
    this hatch hatch Hetchy controversy the
    04:34
    outcomes from it are still affecting us
    04:37
    today now it's time to finish up with
    04:39
    some tests tips for multiple choices
    04:40
    short answer could see short answer
    04:42
    question like comparing and contrasting
    04:43
    preservation and conservatism perhaps
    04:47
    you could see an excerpt about Hetch
    04:49
    Hetchy and the debates over preservation
    04:51
    and conservation long essay and DBQ this
    04:54
    could be part of an essay in the
    04:55
    Progressive Era as this is happening
    04:57
    during that time especially when you
    04:58
    take a Teddy Roosevelt you think of the
    04:59
    Progressive Era or great potential
    05:01
    synthesis point could be connecting this
    05:03
    time to an environmental movement in the
    05:05
    1960s or 1970s essays have you seen as a
    05:08
    post-world War two in the environmental
    05:10
    movement connect it back to you know
    05:13
    kind of the early years of the
    05:15
    environmental movement with conservation

    yo what is going on a push peeps we got
    00:02
    a good one for you today this is on the
    00:04
    Progressive Era this is updated for the
    00:07
    new curriculum and I'm going to cover
    00:08
    everything you need to know about the
    00:10
    Progressive Era to succeed in a push
    00:12
    before we begin you know it shout out
    00:15
    I've got to give shoutouts to Ms Collins
    00:17
    class in Massachusetts mr. Mayer's class
    00:19
    in Washington and mr. Jordans class at
    00:22
    Walsingham Academy best of luck thank
    00:25
    you all for watching and good luck in
    00:28
    May okay we'll start with a brief intro
    00:30
    to the Progressive Era this is the early
    00:33
    twentieth century to about 1920 and
    00:35
    reasons for the emergence of this air
    00:38
    straight from the curriculum is
    00:39
    political corruption as seen in this
    00:42
    very famous political cartoon the bosses
    00:44
    of the Senate economic instability and
    00:47
    social concerns as well so how to fix
    00:51
    these three issues well Perez's wanted
    00:54
    increased government action
    00:56
    characteristics and progressions this is
    00:58
    something you will absolutely positively
    00:59
    have to know be able to identify and
    01:01
    explain them in a short answer if
    01:03
    necessary they tended to be middle and
    01:05
    upper class many women and they favored
    01:08
    expanding democracy so the 17th
    01:11
    amendment this is the direct election of
    01:13
    senators and the 19th amendment is
    01:15
    women's suffrage those were done on a
    01:16
    national level and state local levels
    01:19
    you have things like the initiative
    01:20
    where individuals can propose laws
    01:22
    referendum where individuals can vote on
    01:25
    laws and a recall where individuals can
    01:27
    remove an elected official and that's
    01:29
    how this dude Arnold Schwarzenegger
    01:31
    became governor or the Governator of
    01:33
    California because Gray Davis the
    01:37
    governor of California was recalled ok
    01:39
    so progressive journalists that you
    01:41
    should know they criticize political
    01:43
    corruption such as Lincoln Steffens the
    01:45
    shame of cities which criticize
    01:47
    municipal or city governments social
    01:50
    economic inequality was a focus of Jacob
    01:52
    Reese's how the other half lives and I
    01:55
    to be Wells Barnet she advocates use of
    01:57
    famous journalists that advocated an end
    01:59
    to lynchings of African American and
    02:02
    finally Upton Sinclair's the jungle
    02:04
    focused on working conditions in the
    02:07
    meatpacking industry key progressive
    02:09
    reformers you should know Robert La
    02:10
    Follette governor of Wisconsin
    02:13
    he was instrumental in bringing the
    02:15
    direct primary initiative referendum and
    02:17
    recall to Wisconsin this is known as the
    02:19
    Wisconsin idea Jane Addams holy cow know
    02:22
    her she is the founder of the whole
    02:24
    house in Chicago this house was a
    02:26
    settlement house that aided women
    02:28
    children and immigrants helped them
    02:29
    assimilate in adapt to American society
    02:32
    Florence Kelly worked with Jade Adams
    02:35
    and she advocated increased rights for
    02:36
    women children and African Americans and
    02:39
    she was instrumental in the founding of
    02:41
    the National Consumer League which led
    02:43
    boycotts of goods made by children w eb
    02:46
    Du Bois demanded an immediate end to
    02:49
    segregation and wanted full equality for
    02:52
    African Americans and he helped form a
    02:54
    group called the Niagara movement formed
    02:57
    in Niagara Falls Canada here he is in
    02:59
    the center and that helped morph into
    03:01
    the n-double-a-cp a civil rights
    03:03
    organization that is still around today
    03:05
    and will play very instrumental role in
    03:07
    the civil rights movement in the 1950s
    03:09
    progressive presidents Deneau Roosevelt
    03:12
    Square Deal this focus on consumer
    03:13
    protection such as the Meat Inspection
    03:15
    Act corporate regulation such as the
    03:18
    northern securities decision which broke
    03:20
    up JP Morgan's company and the Hepburn
    03:25
    Act which increased the power of the ICC
    03:27
    the Interstate Commerce Commission and
    03:29
    he also was big on conservation of
    03:31
    natural resources we'll talk more about
    03:33
    that in a few minutes
    03:34
    Taft was the real trust buster more so
    03:37
    than Roosevelt but he had a falling-out
    03:38
    with Roosevelt that led Roosevelt that
    03:41
    led to rose about running for president
    03:43
    in 1912 and here the two fighting over
    03:46
    different issue Wilson's new freedom he
    03:49
    wanted lower tariffs remember he was a
    03:51
    Democrat Democrats once he tariff rates
    03:53
    decrease he eliminated trusts wanted to
    03:56
    eliminate trusts with no distinction
    03:57
    between good or bad trusts unlike Teddy
    03:59
    who did have a distinction between good
    04:01
    and bad trusts Clayton Antitrust Act
    04:03
    strengthened the Sherman Antitrust Act
    04:05
    in exempted unions anyone to reform the
    04:08
    banking system through the Federal
    04:10
    Reserve Act some progressive amendments
    04:12
    you should know sixteenth Amendment this
    04:13
    is a graduated income tax 17th amendment
    04:16
    is the draft election of senators and
    04:18
    connect this if you're writing or you
    04:20
    see this on a multiple choice question
    04:22
    connect this to the populist era these
    04:24
    were goals of the
    04:26
    populist party they teeth amend mr.
    04:28
    prohibition of alcohol and the 19th
    04:30
    amendment is women's suffrage and you
    04:32
    see here with this political cartoon
    04:33
    titled The Awakening a lot of western
    04:36
    states granted suffrage to women first
    04:38
    and then it moved eastward to the whole
    04:42
    country with the 19th amendment ok
    04:44
    conservation and preservation to terms
    04:46
    you should know conservation advocated
    04:48
    the proper use of nature and resources
    04:51
    so humans could use the wilderness an
    04:53
    example this is Teddy Roosevelt
    04:55
    preservation is protecting nature and
    04:58
    land from humans keeping humans out of
    05:00
    the wilderness and this is something
    05:03
    that was advocated by John Muir and the
    05:05
    Sierra Club and I do have a video titled
    05:07
    conservation and preservation in the
    05:09
    Progressive Era with much more details
    05:11
    some tests tips we'll finish up with
    05:13
    multiple choice of short-answer
    05:14
    characteristics and goals of
    05:15
    progressives definitely know the
    05:17
    characteristics and their goals you can
    05:19
    see an excerpt from a book maybe it's
    05:20
    the jungle maybe it's how the other half
    05:22
    lives
    05:22
    conservation vs. preservation definitely
    05:25
    no Francaise is analyzing the extent to
    05:27
    which the Progressive Era foster change
    05:29
    for different groups or the government
    05:31
    that could be changed for African
    05:32
    Americans change for women change for
    05:35
    the government on the federal and state
    05:36
    levels and you could also see comparing
    05:39
    contrasting progresses with either the
    05:41
    populace or another era perhaps the New
    05:43
    Deal which we'll get to later all right
    05:47

    comments and I will do my best to get to

    it alright key concept 8.1 states the
    00:40
    United States responded to an uncertain
    00:42
    in unstable post-war world by asserting
    00:45
    and working to maintain a position of
    00:48
    global leadership with far-reaching
    00:50
    domestic and international consequences
    00:52
    so some big idea questions you should be
    00:54
    able to answer by the end of this video
    00:56
    are what were different ways the u.s.
    00:57
    sought to contain communism both
    01:00
    domestically and abroad
    01:02
    how did independence movements
    01:04
    throughout the world affect the Cold War
    01:06
    and how did the Vietnam War impact
    01:09
    domestic life very important topics
    01:12
    which you will be an expert on all right
    01:14
    let's take a look at Roman numeral one
    01:15
    it says United States policymakers
    01:17
    engaged in a cold war with authoritarian
    01:19
    Soviet Union seeking to limit the growth
    01:22
    of communist military power and
    01:24
    ideological influence create a
    01:26
    free-market global economy and build an
    01:28
    international security system in other
    01:31
    words to stop the Soviet Union from
    01:33
    becoming too powerful now latter a
    01:35
    states the wartime alliance between the
    01:38
    Soviet Union and the Allies dissolved
    01:40
    keep in mind the Soviet Union the US
    01:42
    France Great Britain all fought on the
    01:44
    same side during World War two but once
    01:46
    that war was over the Alliance
    01:48
    disappeared in the US will develop a
    01:51
    foreign policy based on collective
    01:53
    security or security for a big group of
    01:56
    people and you see this through the
    01:57
    North Atlantic Treaty Organization or
    01:59
    NATO which was created by the US and its
    02:02
    allies like Great Britain and France and
    02:04
    this was created in an effort to limit
    02:07
    the power of the Soviet Union if one
    02:10
    country was attacked a NATO it was as if
    02:12
    a
    02:12
    all were attacked we also have
    02:14
    international aid whether it's the
    02:16
    Marshall Plan which provided billions of
    02:18
    dollars to Europe to rebuild the
    02:20
    continent that was just destroyed during
    02:22
    World War two or the Truman Doctrine
    02:24
    which put four hundred million dollars
    02:25
    in military aid to Greece and Turkey so
    02:28
    the u.s. is going to provide lots of
    02:30
    money to European countries to improve
    02:32
    their economies and hopefully make
    02:34
    communism and the Soviet Union less
    02:36
    appealing also economic institutions
    02:39
    were created that bolstered non
    02:41
    communist nations you see things like
    02:42
    the International Monetary Fund or the
    02:44
    IMF which was created in 1944 and this
    02:48
    organization hopes to promote trade and
    02:50
    provide loans to countries in need so
    02:53
    there's different ways the u.s. tried to
    02:55
    limit the appeal of communism so the
    02:58
    u.s. is going to contain communism
    03:00
    through a variety of measures now
    03:02
    definitely know this term containment it
    03:04
    was coined by this dude George F Kenan
    03:07
    he's really the father of containment
    03:09
    here's an interesting fact dude lived to
    03:11
    be a hundred and one years old he died
    03:14
    on March 17th 2501 years old that dudes
    03:17
    a champ so he created this this term
    03:19
    containment urge United States to
    03:21
    basically keep communism from spreading
    03:24
    you can't really stop it from existing
    03:27
    but you can keep it from spreading and
    03:29
    this is really going to be the idea that
    03:31
    will influence Wars like Korea and
    03:33
    Vietnam and this goes along with the
    03:36
    domino theory that if one country were
    03:38
    to become communist that other countries
    03:40
    would be as well we also have massive
    03:43
    retaliation and this is the idea that
    03:44
    the US would respond with more force if
    03:47
    attacked and I'd like to call this the
    03:49
    Ron Burgundy method you know that
    03:52
    escalated quickly if you've ever seen
    03:54
    anchorman the idea that if the US were
    03:56
    to get attacked they would respond and
    03:58
    even more force than they were attacked
    04:00
    with and you also see trying to contain
    04:03
    communism through the space race so this
    04:05
    is a reaction to Sputnik the satellite
    04:07
    that was launched in outer space and
    04:09
    this dude Yuri Gagarin's the first human
    04:12
    to ever orbit outer space and he did so
    04:14
    on April 12 hmm what happened on a photo
    04:18
    my god it's Henry Clay's birthday happy
    04:20
    birthday to Henry Clay
    04:21
    dude just keeps coming back so the u.s.
    04:23
    is going to begin a space race with the
    04:26
    Soviet you
    04:26
    into try to show that the u.s. is
    04:28
    technologically advanced as well so they
    04:30
    will build up their space program and
    04:32
    pour a lot of money into education in
    04:34
    the United States to try to make
    04:36
    themselves on par with the Soviet Union
    04:39
    when it comes to outer space okay so the
    04:41
    Cold War it will fluctuate between
    04:43
    direct and indirect military
    04:45
    confrontation so we have the Cuban
    04:47
    Missile Crisis so it's 13 days in
    04:48
    October 1962 which the u.s. found
    04:51
    missiles in Cuba only 90 miles off the
    04:54
    coast of Florida this is the closest the
    04:57
    USS Soviet Union ever came to war and I
    05:00
    do have a detailed video on the Cold War
    05:02
    in Cuba as well as the the Vietnam War
    05:04
    and the Korean War in the description so
    05:06
    make sure you check them out then we
    05:08
    have date on to know this term it
    05:09
    specifically mentioned this is easy
    05:11
    enough tensions between superpowers an
    05:13
    example this is assault treaties or the
    05:16
    strategic arms limitation talks which
    05:18
    then turn into treaties and this began
    05:20
    with Nixon's administration's Nixon's
    05:22
    administration and continued through
    05:24
    Carter so in the late to 1970s you see
    05:27
    this and this was an agreement these
    05:29
    were agreements to limit certain types
    05:31
    of nuclear weapons what we'll see after
    05:34
    World War two is there's this huge
    05:35
    decolonization movement in Asia Africa
    05:38
    and the Middle East a lot of countries
    05:39
    are going to be giving up their overseas
    05:41
    colonies the US will even give
    05:43
    independence to the Philippines
    05:45
    so with these countries not becoming
    05:48
    independence independent the US and the
    05:50
    Soviet Union will seek allies among
    05:52
    these new nations and many of them are
    05:54
    just going to want to remain neutral so
    05:57
    for instance in May of 1948 when Israel
    05:59
    was created the u.s. recognized Israel
    06:02
    almost immediately any revolution the US
    06:04
    kind of looked at it as if they were
    06:06
    pawns of the Soviet Union the Cold War
    06:09
    will also be felt in Latin America in
    06:11
    which the US will support non communist
    06:13
    regimes with varying levels of
    06:15
    commitment to democracy so pretty much
    06:17
    the the idea of the u.s. is they would
    06:19
    support almost any type of government as
    06:21
    long as they weren't communist so in
    06:23
    1954 the CIA helped overthrow the
    06:27
    democratically elected leader our bends
    06:29
    in Guatemala because he nationalized
    06:31
    land owned by the United Fruit Company
    06:33
    now you'll hear a lot in this time
    06:35
    period period eight of nationalizing
    06:37
    what that means is the government is
    06:39
    going to take land from
    06:40
    knees and it now belongs to them so the
    06:43
    US will be concerned that that sounds a
    06:44
    little too much like communism so our
    06:46
    benz is going to be overthrown and he
    06:48
    will be replaced with a military
    06:50
    dictator our mas let's go to Roman
    06:52
    numeral 2 cold war policies led to
    06:54
    public debates over the power of the
    06:55
    federal government and acceptable means
    06:58
    for pursuing international and domestic
    06:59
    goals while protecting civil liberties
    07:02
    so there will be debates over methods to
    07:05
    root out domestic communists this will
    07:07
    be especially true in the late 1940s
    07:10
    early 1950s so President Truman Hillen
    07:13
    issue an executive order 9 8:35 this was
    07:16
    a loyalty oath for federal employees so
    07:18
    all federal employees had to pledge
    07:19
    loyalty to the United States and confirm
    07:22
    that they were not communist late 1940s
    07:24
    early 1950s we have the second Red Scare
    07:27
    this happens after World War two just
    07:28
    like the first Red Scare happened after
    07:30
    World War one so an example of second
    07:32
    Red Scare is the hue AK is hue AK in
    07:35
    Hollywood ten hue accents for the House
    07:37
    Committee of unamerican activities in
    07:39
    which the House of Representatives would
    07:41
    call hearings and an investigate
    07:44
    suspected communists or people they
    07:45
    thought might be communist and the
    07:47
    Hollywood ten was a group of Hollywood
    07:50
    producers and directors who were called
    07:52
    before hue AK and refused to testify
    07:55
    McCarthyism is in the late 1940s early
    07:57
    1950s as well he was the senator from
    08:00
    Wisconsin in which he claimed to have
    08:02
    known the names of many communists that
    08:05
    infiltrated the the State Department and
    08:07
    here he is giving a speech and look at
    08:09
    this poor guy he is like what am I doing
    08:11
    here what is going on he's scared and
    08:13
    both political parties they supported
    08:15
    containing the threat of communism so
    08:17
    Eisenhower will support this in Iran
    08:20
    when the when the leader mosaic is
    08:22
    overthrown and replaced for the Shah of
    08:23
    Iran and in Guatemala which we just
    08:26
    talked about with our Benz being
    08:27
    overthrown and Truman will send troops
    08:29
    to create a fight in order to stop the
    08:31
    spread of communism in Korea and LBJ
    08:34
    will do the same in Vietnam as well so
    08:39
    domestic opposition to Wars there was
    08:41
    some with the Korean War but not really
    08:43
    much at all we'll see what the Vietnam
    08:45
    War the locker drags on the more
    08:46
    passionate the protests became and even
    08:49
    some violence accompanied with them so
    08:52
    in 1960 in January 19th
    08:54
    did the Vietnamese new year that we have
    08:57
    the Tet Offensive which is when the
    08:59
    North Vietnamese communists attacked the
    09:01
    south and from a long time the US
    09:04
    government kept telling America were
    09:05
    winning this war the war will be over
    09:07
    we're doing a great job and this
    09:09
    surprised many people that the North
    09:10
    Vietnamese were able to have such a
    09:13
    large attack surprise attack on the
    09:15
    south and the American so this was
    09:17
    really a turning point the Vietnam War
    09:18
    in which many people began to protest
    09:20
    more so we see groups like the students
    09:23
    for a Democratic Society or SDS they use
    09:25
    violence as time went on to protest and
    09:27
    in May 1970 at Kent State in Ohio we
    09:30
    have students protesting this was a
    09:32
    reaction to the u.s. bombing Cambodia
    09:34
    and here is a map of the shooting that
    09:37
    happened at that campus in which four
    09:40
    Kent State students were killed by the
    09:42
    Ohio National Guard
    09:44
    all right so Americans began to debate
    09:46
    as time went on the merits of a large
    09:48
    nuclear arsenal the USS Soviet Union had
    09:51
    so many nuclear weapons that they could
    09:52
    destroy the world several times over and
    09:55
    Eisenhower's farewell address he warned
    09:57
    of what he called the
    09:58
    military-industrial complex which is the
    10:01
    build-up of military industries
    10:03
    throughout the United States and he
    10:05
    cautioned that the US could be spending
    10:08
    lots of money and be in a perpetual
    10:10
    state of ready for Warren here's
    10:12
    Eisenhower so the power of the executive
    10:14
    branch him and foreign and military
    10:15
    policy will increase drastically as well
    10:18
    during this time in many Americans begin
    10:20
    to debate whether or not that is a good
    10:22
    thing so Congress will reverse the Gulf
    10:24
    of Tonkin Resolution with the War Powers
    10:26
    Act and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution
    10:28
    essentially gave LBJ a blank check to
    10:32
    escalate the conflict in Vietnam as much
    10:35
    as he saw necessary and the War Powers
    10:36
    Act will limit the ability of the
    10:39
    President to send troops in combat
    10:42
    without consulting with Congress so the
    10:45
    u.s. involvement in the Middle East was
    10:46
    shaped by ideological military and
    10:48
    economic concerns in 1956 the Suez
    10:51
    Crisis occurs in which Nasser of Egypt
    10:53
    II nationalizes that were nationalize
    10:56
    again the Suez Canal and Britain and
    10:58
    France attacked Egypt they were upset
    11:00
    because they had control of the canal
    11:02
    the u.s. helped end the conflict because
    11:04
    they were afraid that the Soviets would
    11:06
    get involved and that you
    11:08
    it might side with the Soviet Union we
    11:10
    have a series of oil crises that help
    11:12
    initiate attempts at creating a national
    11:14
    energy policy this is something that's
    11:16
    even true today with oil we are still
    11:19
    very much dependent on it and the
    11:21
    Organization of Petroleum Exporting
    11:22
    Countries or OPEC was created by mostly
    11:26
    Middle Eastern countries and they hope
    11:28
    to control the supply of oil and there's
    11:29
    the flag for OPEC and after the u.s.
    11:32
    supported Israel in 1973 during the Yom
    11:34
    Kippur War OPEC placed an embargo an oil
    11:38
    embargo on the US which drastically
    11:39
    raised gas prices and you would see very
    11:41
    long lines at gas stations all right
    11:45
    some test tips for eight point one for

    the Vietnam War Marshall Plan Truman

    11:59
    the military-industrial complex who is
    12:02
    associated with and what does it mean
    12:04
    for essay questions world war ii is a
    12:06
    turning point for u.s. foreign policy
    12:08
    could be huge because now the u.s. is
    12:11
    heavily involved in foreign affairs
    12:13
    bye-bye George Washington's farewell
    12:14
    address and also comparing and
    12:16
    contrasting post-world War one with
    12:18
    post-world War two the u.s. reverted
    12:21
    back to isolationism after World War one
    12:23
    but they are anything but isolated after

    luck and may you will do great
    00:33
    all right he cats update point to
    00:34
    state's new movements for civil rights
    00:36
    and liberal efforts to expand the role
    00:38
    of government generated a range of
    00:40
    political and cultural responses so it's
    00:43
    a big idea questions you should be able
    00:44
    to answer while were some examples of
    00:47
    successes during the civil rights
    00:48
    movement and how did the federal
    00:50
    government contribute to this
    00:51
    how did awareness for groups such as
    00:54
    Latinos American Indians Asian Americans
    00:56
    women and gays and lesbians change
    00:59
    during this time and why were some
    01:01
    people on the left and the right
    01:03
    assailing liberalism all right Roman
    01:05
    numeral one states seeking to fulfill
    01:07
    Reconstruction era promises civil rights
    01:09
    activists and political leaders achieved
    01:11
    some legal and political successes in
    01:14
    ending segregation
    01:15
    although the progress toward equality
    01:17
    was slow and halting so after World War
    01:20
    two civil rights activists are going to
    01:22
    use a variety of strategies to challenge
    01:24
    racial segregation be familiar with the
    01:27
    different types of strategies this could
    01:29
    be a great short answer question so
    01:31
    there were legal challenges an example
    01:33
    of the case is brown versus the Board of
    01:35
    Education which was led by an attorney
    01:37
    for the n-double-a-cp
    01:38
    Thurgood Marshall who became a future
    01:41
    Supreme Court justice and there is
    01:43
    justice Marshall you also have direct
    01:47
    action people like Fannie Lou Hamer and
    01:49
    Freedom Summer in which they sought to
    01:51
    increase the number of African Americans
    01:53
    registered to vote in Mississippi and of
    01:55
    course you have nonviolent protest
    01:57
    tactics used by people like Martin
    01:59
    Luther King and the Montgomery bus
    02:00
    boycott here's Rosa Parks the day that
    02:03
    she was arrested and also sit-ins that
    02:06
    began in Greensboro North Carolina and
    02:08
    then inspired other sit-ins across the
    02:11
    country and other ends such as
    02:13
    Oh lens and weighed ins and knee lens at
    02:15
    churches you name it there were ends all
    02:17
    across the country trying to get rid of
    02:19
    segregation so all three branches help
    02:23
    promote greater racial justice within
    02:26
    the executive branch you see Harry
    02:27
    Truman's executive order 99-81 the
    02:30
    desegregated the US military in 1948 in
    02:33
    the first war that the u.s. fought in
    02:35
    with desegregated troops was the Korean
    02:37
    War for the judicial branch you have
    02:38
    Brown versus Board of Education which
    02:40
    are briefly just mentioned this ruled
    02:41
    that segregation was inherently unequal
    02:44
    and this overturned the disastrous Court
    02:46
    case Plessy vs. Ferguson from 1896 so if
    02:49
    you're writing an essay about the civil
    02:51
    rights movement you mentioned Brown
    02:52
    versus the Board of Education your
    02:54
    synthesis point could be Plessy versus
    02:56
    Ferguson and you also have the
    02:57
    legislative branch promoting greater
    02:59
    racial justice by the Civil Rights Act
    03:01
    in 1964 this was part of LBJ's Great
    03:03
    Society
    03:04
    this was his Great Society was an
    03:07
    extension of the New Deal and it focused
    03:08
    on civil rights and what the Civil
    03:11
    Rights Act of 1964 does and definitely
    03:13
    no it's because it's specifically
    03:15
    mentioned in the new curriculum makes
    03:16
    discrimination in the workplace illegal
    03:18
    and it guarantees equal access to public
    03:21
    accommodation so no longer could places
    03:24
    discriminate based on race white
    03:28
    resistance was slow efforts at
    03:31
    desegregation for instance massive
    03:33
    resistance was it was an ID in the South
    03:35
    that southern schools would rather shut
    03:36
    down before desegregating so you would
    03:39
    see so schools in the South actually did
    03:42
    closed instead of being forced to
    03:43
    desegregate the southern manifesto was
    03:46
    written by 101 congressmen that believed
    03:48
    the Supreme Court overstepped its power
    03:50
    in Brown versus the Board of Education
    03:51
    they looked at the 14th amendment which
    03:54
    the Supreme Court cited in Brown versus
    03:57
    Board and they said nowhere in the
    03:58
    Fourteenth Amendment was segregation
    04:00
    mentioned so many southern congressmen
    04:02
    tried to resist desegregation and of
    04:06
    course probably the most well-known
    04:06
    example is the Little Rock Nine this is
    04:09
    when governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas
    04:11
    he refused to integrate schools and then
    04:13
    President Eisenhower nationalized the
    04:16
    troops to enforce the integration of
    04:19
    nine African American students at Little
    04:21
    Rock high school post 1965 do two thing
    04:25
    do two riots and cities
    04:27
    increase involvement in Vietnam which
    04:29
    many african-americans protested there
    04:30
    were debates that emerged among
    04:32
    activists over tactics and philosophies
    04:34
    so Martin Luther King he's still going
    04:37
    to urge non-violence but many urban
    04:39
    protesters especially those living in
    04:41
    the north are going to become more
    04:43
    frustrated and we see the emergence of
    04:44
    the Black Panther Party they advocated
    04:47
    armed self-defense to use violence if
    04:50
    necessary to protect themselves all
    04:54
    right let's take a look at Roman numeral
    04:55
    two it says responding to social
    04:56
    conditions in the african-american civil
    04:58
    rights movement a variety of movements
    05:00
    emerged that focused on issues of
    05:02
    identity social justice and the
    05:04
    environment so we have feminists and gay
    05:06
    lesbian activists they called for legal
    05:09
    economic and social equality and this
    05:11
    will be an extension of the civil rights
    05:13
    movement definitely no baby for Dan very
    05:15
    famous author she wrote a book called
    05:17
    the feminine mystique and she argued
    05:19
    that many housewives especially suburban
    05:21
    housewives were not happy and felt they
    05:24
    lived unfulfilled lies because many of
    05:26
    them were working to find a home and
    05:27
    raising children and they wanted more
    05:29
    out of life as what she found Gloria
    05:32
    Steinem and she she was and is a very
    05:34
    influential feminist she helped create
    05:37
    the National Women's Political caucus
    05:39
    and this supports women that seek to be
    05:42
    involved in politics and she is the
    05:44
    stepmother of one of my favorite actors
    05:47
    Christian Bale you think he's going
    05:50
    around like where's Gloria that was my
    05:53
    Batman impression we see calls for
    05:55
    social and economic equality for gays
    05:58
    and lesbians as well in 1969 we have the
    06:00
    Stonewall riots in New York City and
    06:02
    this is the birth of the gay rights
    06:04
    movement which riots occurred outside of
    06:06
    the Stonewall Inn a very popular gay and
    06:08
    lesbian establishment where many
    06:10
    customers were arrested by police simply
    06:12
    for being gay so groups that demanded
    06:15
    social and economic equality and to
    06:17
    redress past grievances included so we
    06:20
    see this movement again going beyond
    06:21
    just the civil rights when we see
    06:23
    Latinos led by Cesar Chavez and the
    06:25
    United Farm Workers he led a great
    06:27
    pecker strike to bring attention to the
    06:28
    plight of Mexican American workers he
    06:31
    also went on a hunger strike for like 28
    06:32
    days I believe and he met with
    06:34
    presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy
    06:36
    in 1968 American Indians whether it's
    06:40
    Indians of all tribes or the American
    06:42
    Indian Movement they use protests to
    06:43
    bring attention to the struggles of
    06:45
    Native Americans and the IAT took over
    06:47
    Alcatraz Island in 1969 and Asian
    06:51
    Americans saw California overturning its
    06:55
    alien land law which forbade Japanese
    06:57
    immigrants from owning land so other
    06:59
    minority groups are getting more
    07:01
    equality during this time as well
    07:04
    although it appeared there was overall
    07:06
    influence if you look at especially the
    07:08
    1950s you believe that many people were
    07:10
    living affluent life's poverty was a
    07:13
    national issue and many the people
    07:16
    wanted to reform this so we've Michael
    07:18
    Harrington him the very influential
    07:19
    journalist he writes a book called the
    07:21
    other American this is going to help
    07:23
    influence lyndon b johnson Great Society
    07:25
    program to help out America and he
    07:28
    argued in his book that 25 percent of
    07:30
    the nation and 40 percent of African
    07:32
    Americans were living in poverty and
    07:33
    Native Americans were the hardest hit
    07:35
    group so he said although there appears
    07:37
    to be a lot of affluence in the country
    07:39
    there really is not okay so some
    07:42
    environmental problems and accidents
    07:43
    occur especially in the 1970s in the
    07:46
    1960s Rachel Carson wrote a very famous
    07:48
    influential book called Silent Spring
    07:50
    which she warned about the dangers of
    07:51
    pesticide especially in the water system
    07:54
    this has helped inspire the
    07:56
    Environmental Protection Agency and also
    07:59
    the Clean Air Act and the Environmental
    08:01
    Protection Agency was created under
    08:03
    President Nixon's administration and the
    08:05
    purpose of these was the help protect
    08:06
    the environment and human health then in
    08:09
    the 1970s you have two very bad
    08:12
    disasters environmental disasters one is
    08:15
    Love Canal New York right by Niagara
    08:16
    Falls not too far from where I live and
    08:18
    the other is Three Mile Island a nuclear
    08:20
    power plant disaster in Pennsylvania
    08:24
    this led to the government getting
    08:25
    involved in passing legislation to help
    08:27
    out these communities please please
    08:29
    please know the causes and impacts of
    08:32
    the environmental moving this is a great
    08:34
    potential short answer question Roman
    08:37
    numeral 3 says liberalism influence
    08:39
    post-war politics and Court decisions
    08:41
    but it came under increasing attack from
    08:42
    the left as well as from a resurgent
    08:45
    conservative movement or the right so
    08:47
    question what the heck is liberalism
    08:49
    well it's limiting communism abroad and
    08:51
    it's also the belief in the power
    08:53
    government to achieve goals at home and
    08:56
    this will reach at Zenith or its highest
    08:58
    point in the mid-sixties under LBJ with
    09:01
    a Great Society so what is the Great
    09:03
    Society well it sought to use the
    09:05
    federal power to end racial
    09:07
    discrimination I want you to think it's
    09:09
    a continuation of the New Deal but
    09:11
    there's civil rights and a lot of times
    09:13
    LBJ this guy here on the left he used
    09:16
    his stature he was at all present about
    09:18
    6-3 6-4 to intimidate people what's
    09:21
    known as the Johnson treatment this poor
    09:23
    guys getting the Johnson treatment look
    09:24
    at all this space over here look how
    09:26
    close he is this dude's grill that's how
    09:28
    he got things done if you want to know
    09:29
    more about the Johnson treatment see my
    09:31
    video the presidency of LBJ it is in the
    09:35
    description so as I mentioned earlier
    09:37
    Civil Rights Act in 1964 there's banned
    09:39
    discrimination in public facilities the
    09:41
    Voting Rights Act of 1965 this
    09:43
    eliminated literacy test and the federal
    09:45
    government could register voters in
    09:47
    areas in which minorities were not
    09:49
    registered to vote then we have the
    09:51
    twenty-fourth amendment that eliminated
    09:53
    poll taxes so finally with the Voting
    09:55
    Rights Act of 1965 and the twenty-fourth
    09:58
    amendment the Fifteenth Amendment from
    10:00
    reconstruction which guaranteed suffrage
    10:02
    all males finally comes to fruition so
    10:05
    there's another synthesis connection for
    10:07
    you the Great Society also sought to
    10:08
    eliminate poverty and address other
    10:10
    social issues you have the headstart
    10:11
    program which is early childhood
    10:14
    education in the cabinet position of
    10:16
    Housing and Urban Development which
    10:17
    promoted housing in cities food stamps
    10:20
    Medicare and Medicaid were also part of
    10:22
    the Great Society and LBJ was a former
    10:26
    teacher so education was important to
    10:28
    him billions of dollars were provided
    10:29
    for primary and secondary education now
    10:32
    the Supreme Court also made several
    10:34
    decisions that expanded democracy and
    10:36
    individual freedoms for example Miranda
    10:38
    versus Arizona if you are arrested you
    10:40
    have to be read your Miranda rights can
    10:42
    you say I'm saying right now do you know
    10:43
    it no it's not you have the right to be
    10:45
    an attorney and Griswold versus
    10:48
    Connecticut this struck down a law
    10:49
    forbidding contraception and this set
    10:52
    the precedent that the Constitution
    10:54
    established a right to privacy in that
    10:56
    will be used in later years in Roe vs.
    10:58
    Wade which legalized abortion right the
    11:02
    1960s conservatives began to challenge
    11:05
    liberal laws court decisions and
    11:07
    and perceived moral culture declined so
    11:09
    we see a rise of conservatism or the
    11:11
    rise of the right and conservatives hope
    11:14
    to limit the role of the federal
    11:15
    government go away from this large
    11:17
    government involvement under the Great
    11:18
    Society they wanted to be more assertive
    11:20
    with foreign policy as well not Barry
    11:23
    Goldwater he's gonna run against LBJ in
    11:25
    1964 for election here is Barry he was
    11:28
    much more militant than LBJ and he
    11:31
    called for a smaller government now do
    11:32
    you recognize his dude to his left here
    11:34
    given a speech that is Ronald Reagan he
    11:37
    gave a very famous speech called a time
    11:39
    for choosing which really launched
    11:41
    around reagan's political career Andy a
    11:43
    lot of Reagan's conservative ideas can
    11:45
    really be traced back to Barry Goldwater
    11:48
    there's another potential synthesis
    11:50
    point for you
    11:51
    all right so groups on the leftist say
    11:53
    liberals because or attacked liberals
    11:55
    because they didn't think they went far
    11:57
    enough especially when it came to racial
    11:59
    and economic issues so the Black
    12:01
    Panthers as I mentioned earlier they
    12:02
    urged arming of African Americans for
    12:04
    self-defense and they also created free
    12:07
    breakfast programs in urban areas for
    12:09
    children going to school they realize
    12:11
    the importance of breakfast for young
    12:13
    children
    12:14
    liberals pursued immoral policies abroad
    12:16
    they also argued especially the Vietnam
    12:18
    War when LBJ got the u.s. involved in
    12:20
    Vietnam war so an example this is the
    12:22
    students for a Democratic Society they
    12:24
    protested the Vietnam War as the u.s.
    12:26
    increased involvement and they
    12:28
    criticized the gap between the rich and
    12:30
    the poor and they inspired march
    12:32
    incidents and teach-ins
    12:34
    now we'll see especially in the 1970s
    12:36
    public trust in government is going to
    12:38
    drastically decrease and this will
    12:39
    happen due to several reasons again
    12:42
    another great potential short answer
    12:44
    question we see economic challenges
    12:47
    things like stagflation of the 1970s
    12:49
    stagflation very important term to know
    12:51
    it's high unemployed high inflation and
    12:53
    high unemployment it is an economic
    12:55
    nightmare
    12:56
    there are also political scandals such
    12:58
    as the Watergate scandal which led to
    12:59
    Nixon resigning the first president in
    13:02
    US history to resign and only one and
    13:05
    also foreign policy crises things like
    13:07
    the oil embargo 1973 which saw gas
    13:10
    stations across the country have high
    13:12
    gas prices or even run out of gas the
    13:14
    Vietnam War was another issue that last
    13:16
    that lasted many years in there Ron
    13:18
    hostage crisis of nineteen
    13:20
    79 under President Carter's
    13:22
    administration he was unable to rescue
    13:24
    the hostages from the US Embassy in Iran
    13:27
    right so conservatives and liberals are
    13:30
    gonna clash over the following issues
    13:31
    one social and cultural issues so we'll
    13:34
    see changes to the American family in
    13:36
    the 1970s in particular we'll see
    13:37
    divorce rates increase more women are
    13:39
    working outside the home and that
    13:41
    challenged the traditional family idea
    13:43
    of the 1950s power the federal
    13:45
    government will be another issue
    13:46
    conservatives are going to want a
    13:48
    smaller government they'll be against
    13:50
    things like the Great Society this is
    13:52
    true even to today conservatives call
    13:54
    for smaller government race will be an
    13:56
    issue the Supreme Court case Bach vs.
    13:58
    University of California the Supreme
    14:00
    Court upheld affirmative action however
    14:02
    they ruled that quotas were not allowed
    14:05
    so somebody's race could be a factor in
    14:08
    admitting somebody into college but
    14:10
    there the use of quotas or setting aside
    14:13
    a certain amount of spots for somebody
    14:15
    based on their race is not allowed as
    14:18
    what the Supreme Court said Phyllis
    14:20
    Schlafly she was a critic of the e ra or
    14:22
    the Equal Rights Amendment this was an
    14:24
    amendment to the Constitution that came
    14:26
    close to passing but did not pass she
    14:28
    argued that the RA would take away
    14:30
    certain benefits for women and her
    14:33
    campaign held lead to the defeat of the
    14:35
    e ra it came about three or four states
    14:37
    shy of being ratified if I remember
    14:39
    correctly all right so let's finish up
    14:41
    with some test tips for multiple choice
    14:42
    and short answer definitely no examples
    14:44
    of strategies used by civil rights
    14:46
    activists whether it's direct action
    14:47
    legal action and nonviolent protest how
    14:50
    all three branches contribute to the
    14:52
    civil rights movement these two things
    14:54
    sound like a great short answer question
    14:56
    to me so make sure you are familiar with
    14:59
    them Great Society you pretty much need
    15:01
    to know everything about it
    15:02
    criticisms of liberalism on the left and
    15:04
    the right what were criticisms from each
    15:07
    side and four essays and dbq's
    15:09
    definitely be able to compare and
    15:10
    contrast the civil rights movement with
    15:12
    earlier time periods for example from
    15:14
    the 1890s to the 1920s with people like
    15:16
    Booker T Washington w eb Du Bois Marcus
    15:19
    Garvey etc compare and contrast them
    15:21
    with the 1950s and 1960s civil rights
    15:23
    movement and also comparing the women's
    15:25
    rights movement with earlier time
    15:27
    periods for instance the 1840s with the
    15:30
    Seneca Falls convention or the 1920s
    15:32
    with flappers
    15:33

    the world and best of luck to you all
    00:30
    on your exam in May all right key
    00:32
    concept 8.3 state post-war economic and
    00:35
    demographic changes had a far-reaching
    00:37
    impact on American society politics and
    00:40
    culture so it's the big idea questions
    00:42
    to think about as we go through this
    00:43
    video how did economic growth impact
    00:46
    American society and American values and
    00:48
    how did new immigration laws in 1965
    00:51
    impact immigrants this could address the
    00:54
    historical thinking skills of change and
    00:56
    continuity and finally how did the
    00:59
    counterculture impact American society
    01:01
    alright
    01:02
    Roman numeral one states rapid economic
    01:04
    and social changes in American society
    01:06
    fostered or encouraged a sense of
    01:08
    optimism in the post-war years so we
    01:11
    have a burgeoning and that means
    01:12
    increasing private sector so why is this
    01:15
    private sector or the economy really
    01:17
    increasing and doing well while we have
    01:19
    federal spending things like the
    01:20
    interstate highway system created in
    01:23
    nineteen in the 1950s by Eisenhower was
    01:26
    the largest government works project in
    01:28
    US history we had the baby boom
    01:30
    generation and here is a picture of a
    01:32
    baby boomer this is my mother born in
    01:34
    1955 smack dab in the middle of the baby
    01:38
    boom generation so this is the largest
    01:40
    generation in American history so with
    01:43
    that comes lots of consumer spending and
    01:45
    also we have technological developments
    01:47
    things like the TV during this time
    01:49
    become very very popular and all of
    01:51
    those contributed to economic growth now
    01:55
    what is the impact of higher education
    01:56
    opportunities more and more people are
    01:58
    going to college of the GI Bill of
    01:59
    Rights and these new technologies well
    02:01
    we see in migration of middle class to
    02:03
    the suburbs especially suburbs like
    02:06
    Levittown right near New York City and
    02:08
    this really encouraged the growth of
    02:10
    suburbs and other areas of the country
    02:13
    and we had the growth of the Sunbelt and
    02:15
    that is really going to gain influence
    02:17
    during this time this is those those
    02:19
    southern states from California all the
    02:21
    way over through Texas and Florida and
    02:23
    up to Virginia that's the Sun Belt we'll
    02:25
    see since the end of World War two that
    02:28
    area is going to be growing a population
    02:30
    at expense of the frost belt or the
    02:32
    colder areas like New York where I'm
    02:34
    from we also internal and international
    02:37
    immigration is going to increase and
    02:39
    that's because of economic opportunities
    02:42
    that is a theme throughout US history
    02:44
    so the immigration law of 1965
    02:46
    absolutely positively know this and
    02:48
    abolish the quota system from the 1920s
    02:50
    you remember the 1921 to 1924 X which
    02:53
    severely restricted immigration of
    02:55
    course you do those are now gone in 1965
    02:59
    families of legal immigrants living in
    03:01
    the u.s. were giving preferential
    03:02
    treatment so they encouraged the
    03:04
    immigration of families and this
    03:06
    especially will benefit immigrants from
    03:08
    Latin America and Asia and here is LBJ
    03:12
    right outside the Statue of Liberty on
    03:14
    the day he signed this law right Roman
    03:17
    numeral two states new demographic and
    03:18
    social developments along with anxieties
    03:20
    over the Cold War change US culture and
    03:23
    led to significant political and moral
    03:25
    debates that sharply divided the nation
    03:27
    so we had the rise of homogeneous mass
    03:29
    culture this was caused by economic and
    03:32
    social changes anxiety over the Cold War
    03:34
    and this was also challenged by artists
    03:37
    and elections and youth so The Beat
    03:40
    movement absolutely no The Beat movement
    03:42
    this can be compared to the Lost
    03:43
    Generation of the 1920s these are
    03:45
    authors and writers that challenged
    03:48
    middle class conformity and a very
    03:49
    famous member of the Beat movement is
    03:51
    Jack Kerouac and he wrote his book on
    03:53
    the road the effluence Society was
    03:55
    published in 1958 and this brought
    03:57
    attention to income disparity in
    03:59
    post-world War two u.s. the idea that
    04:01
    there's this growing gap between the
    04:03
    rich and the poor and there's a lot of
    04:04
    poor people living in the United States
    04:06
    during this time and we also have
    04:08
    rock-and-roll music things like Elvis
    04:10
    Presley and the Beatles were very very
    04:12
    influential during this time and here is
    04:15
    Jack Kerouac and of course you know
    04:17
    Elvis Presley who learned how to dance
    04:18
    from Forrest Gump
    04:21
    alright feminists in the counterculture
    04:23
    the 1960s counterculture where we're
    04:24
    talking about them we're talking about
    04:26
    hippie
    04:27
    so they rejected many of their parents
    04:29
    generations values so socially they
    04:32
    would use marijuana and you see the
    04:33
    emergence of new music and nowhere do
    04:36
    you see music highlighted better than at
    04:38
    Woodstock in 1969 economic values they
    04:42
    reject they rejected materialism and
    04:44
    they sought to live a simpler life and
    04:46
    politically they were very active in the
    04:49
    protest movement of the Vietnam War also
    04:51
    in the civil rights movement and the
    04:53
    promotion of women's rights so what did
    04:57
    this initiate well we have changes in
    04:58
    sexual norms and greater informal tea
    05:01
    and formal tea in u.s. culture all right
    05:06
    so we have a rise of evangelical
    05:07
    Christian churches and organizations
    05:09
    when you think about born-again
    05:11
    Christians this really becomes popular
    05:13
    during the 1970s and 80s and this this
    05:17
    is a focus on personal conversion and
    05:19
    this was accompanied by great political
    05:21
    and social activism by religious
    05:23
    conservatives so we see the emergence of
    05:26
    religious conservatives being involved
    05:28
    in politics and they will often support
    05:31
    the Republican Party this is a response
    05:33
    in part to Roe vs. Wade the Supreme
    05:36
    Court case that legalized abortion in
    05:38
    1973 people like Jerry Falwell and his
    05:41
    moral majority become very influential
    05:43
    during this time he opposed the Equal
    05:45
    Rights Amendment the strategic arms
    05:47
    limitation treaty abortion and
    05:49
    homosexuals as one he was very very
    05:52
    influential especially in the 1970s and
    05:54
    1980s another group focused on the
    05:56
    family they promoted abstinence they
    05:58
    were also against same-sex marriage and
    06:00
    are pro-life so again we see a religious
    06:04
    movement accompanied with involvement in
    06:06
    politics right some test tips for
    06:10
    multiple choice and short answer be able
    06:12
    to explain identify and explain the rise
    06:14
    of conservative movement family
    06:16
    structures and counterculture what were
    06:17
    they like during this time if for essays
    06:19
    immigration comparing post 1965 with
    06:22
    prior time periods maybe the 1920s
    06:25
    immigration quotas maybe new immigrants
    06:27
    with older immigrants immigration is a
    06:28
    very popular topic you should know and
    06:30
    finally again the rise of the
    06:32
    conservative movement making connections
    06:34
    to previous videos from period 8 to the
    06:38
    1960s under LBJ
    06:39
    this growth of big government in people

    you all thank you so much you all will
    00:44
    do great on your exam
    00:47
    all right let's take a look at what key
    00:48
    concept 9.1 states a newly ascendant or
    00:51
    rising and power conservative movement
    00:54
    achieve several political and policy
    00:56
    goals during the 1980s and continued to
    00:59
    strongly influence public discourse in
    01:01
    the following decades so this is about
    01:03
    the birth and rise of the conservative
    01:06
    movement some big idea questions you
    01:08
    should know why changes occurred in the
    01:10
    economy as a result of Reagan's election
    01:12
    in 1980 and over what issues did
    01:15
    conservatives and liberals debate ok
    01:17
    Roman numeral one conservative beliefs
    01:19
    regarding the need for traditional
    01:21
    social values and a reduced role for
    01:24
    government advanced in US politics after
    01:26
    1980 make sure you understand that
    01:29
    conservatives call for traditional
    01:31
    values and a smaller government so they
    01:33
    really are going to focus on a smaller
    01:35
    government that is paramount to
    01:37
    understanding all right so why was
    01:39
    Reagan's election in 1980 seen as a
    01:41
    milestone or if you really want to
    01:44
    impress the AP readers use the word
    01:46
    watershed event or watershed election
    01:49
    that means like a major turning point
    01:51
    well conservatives begin to enact the
    01:53
    following things we have tax cuts
    01:55
    Reaganomics also known as supply-side
    01:57
    economics or trickle-down economics they
    01:59
    all pretty much are the same thing
    02:01
    here's Reagan illustrating explaining
    02:04
    his program on TV this is the idea that
    02:07
    there should be tax cuts for the wealthy
    02:08
    in order to stimulate economic growth
    02:11
    and tax rates were cut
    02:14
    pretty heavily in the 1980s this is
    02:16
    similar to tax policies of the 1920s
    02:20
    Under Secretary of Treasury Andrew
    02:22
    Mellon that's a synthesis point if
    02:24
    you're writing about the economy in the
    02:25
    8th 1920s or the 1980s feel free to use
    02:29
    them connect the two and there's your
    02:31
    synthesis point and there's also
    02:32
    deregulation of many industries
    02:34
    especially Reagan promising in his
    02:37
    campaign to decrease environmental
    02:39
    regulations that were more favorable to
    02:41
    businesses now conservatives will hope
    02:45
    to limit liberal programs things that
    02:48
    were enacted under the New Deal and even
    02:51
    some of the Great Society but they will
    02:52
    meet inertia or resistance and liberal
    02:56
    opposition and this is because many of
    02:58
    these programs will remain popular with
    03:00
    voters so for example Social Security
    03:02
    and Medicare those are beneficial to the
    03:05
    elderly and the elderly vote more than
    03:07
    any other demographic so it's very hard
    03:09
    to limit these programs if these people
    03:12
    vote because they will vote for people
    03:13
    that supports these programs so
    03:15
    understand even though conservatives
    03:17
    wanted to limit the size and scope of
    03:20
    government it was difficult to get rid
    03:21
    of some programs now policy debates are
    03:25
    going to emerge regarding free trade
    03:27
    agreements this is something that's even
    03:29
    true today in 2016 think of NAFTA the
    03:32
    North American Free Trade Agreement this
    03:34
    is when no tariffs would be placed on
    03:37
    goods that are made and traded between
    03:39
    America Canada and Mexico now if you own
    03:41
    an Xbox 360 that is made right across
    03:44
    the border from the United States in
    03:46
    Mexico because there is no tariff when
    03:48
    it is shipped into the United States in
    03:51
    Seattle in 1999 there's a World Trade
    03:54
    Organization meeting and there were
    03:56
    several protests outside and here is a
    03:58
    picture of the craziness that occurred
    04:01
    these protesters were getting pepper
    04:03
    sprayed by this police officer now the
    04:07
    scope and of the government and the
    04:08
    social safety net has been debated how
    04:10
    big should the government be how much of
    04:12
    a social safety net should there be and
    04:14
    in 1996 under Bill Clinton we had
    04:17
    welfare reform and some viewed the
    04:19
    public as becoming too dependent on
    04:21
    government assistance or that they
    04:23
    became too reliant on
    04:25
    government programs so this instituted
    04:28
    time limits on welfare assistance and
    04:30
    also increased eligibility requirements
    04:33
    so this really kind of reduced the
    04:35
    amount of welfare that people were
    04:36
    getting and the length of time that they
    04:38
    were getting it there are also calls to
    04:40
    reform the US financial system you see
    04:42
    this in the area finance reform
    04:43
    financial services Modernization Act
    04:45
    this repealed parts of the
    04:47
    glass-steagall Act from the New Deal so
    04:49
    many people can service in particular
    04:51
    going to call for deregulation of the
    04:54
    financial system right for tests tips
    04:57
    multiple choice and short answer be able
    04:59
    to identify and explain the goals of
    05:00
    conservatives NAFTA and the debates over
    05:02
    free trade that's just one example of it
    05:05
    and debates over the scope and size of
    05:07
    government for long essay a DBQ you will
    05:10
    not see one exclusively on period nine
    05:12
    but it could be part of a larger idea
    05:14
    for instance debates over scope and size
    05:16
    of the federal government since World
    05:18
    War two and reasons for the rise of the
    05:20
    conservative movement

    00:37
    luck to you all you are brilliant you
    00:39
    will do great and never forget you were
    00:41
    always more than a test score
    00:44
    all right key concept 9.2 States moving
    00:47
    into the 21st century the nation
    00:48
    experienced significant technological
    00:50
    economic and demographic changes so it's
    00:54
    the big idea questions to focus on how
    00:56
    has the economy changed since 1980 and
    00:58
    what are the impacts of internal
    01:00
    migration and immigrants on the United
    01:03
    States guys this is that's a question
    01:05
    that we have examined throughout this
    01:08
    entire course all right Roman number one
    01:11
    states new developments in science and
    01:13
    technology enhance the economy and
    01:15
    transform society while manufacturing
    01:17
    decreased the question is why did
    01:19
    American participation and worldwide
    01:21
    economic opportunities increase think of
    01:24
    global it as globalization well we have
    01:27
    economic productivity is increasing
    01:30
    that's a result of new machines digital
    01:32
    communication is going to increase think
    01:34
    about email cell phones that building
    01:36
    for people to connect and talk to people
    01:39
    throughout the world in a matter of
    01:40
    seconds or split seconds is drastically
    01:43
    increasing and and that's through
    01:45
    computers email phones etc they're
    01:48
    connecting people to the world instantly
    01:50
    and I remember when I was in Middle
    01:52
    School my mom had a cell phone like this
    01:54
    and it would charge you for roaming and
    01:57
    it was like 25 cents a minute it's
    01:59
    insane so the evolution of the cell
    02:00
    phones in the last 20 years is
    02:01
    absolutely incredible
    02:03
    let it be what is the impact of these
    02:05
    technological innovations well we've
    02:07
    increased access to information
    02:09
    especially when it comes to news and
    02:12
    this will lead to many pre
    02:13
    newspapers shutting down and they're
    02:15
    being replaced in there they're
    02:17
    switching over to the digital media or
    02:19
    they are being replaced by the digital
    02:21
    media think about the internet chances
    02:23
    are that's probably where you get most
    02:24
    of your information and news from we
    02:27
    have new social behaviors and networks
    02:29
    that are merging things like Facebook
    02:31
    Twitter you name it people are
    02:32
    connecting in different ways also we
    02:35
    have an increase of the service sector
    02:37
    employment so manufacturing is
    02:39
    decreasing but we have an increase in
    02:41
    people who have service jobs and as a
    02:44
    result of manufacturing decreasing
    02:46
    there's also a decrease in union
    02:48
    membership and you see this especially
    02:50
    in cities in the north is known as the
    02:52
    Rust Belt northern cities that lost
    02:54
    manufacturing jobs my city of Buffalo
    02:57
    there are many empty buildings down
    02:59
    there this is a building from Detroit
    03:00
    you see this happening in Cleveland new
    03:02
    name a lot of northern cities they used
    03:04
    to be very influential in terms of
    03:06
    population centers and economy the
    03:09
    population has decreased so Academy in
    03:12
    the post 1980 world while wages are
    03:15
    going to stagnate and that's a fancy
    03:17
    word for stop so let's take a look at
    03:20
    median family income going back to 1980
    03:24
    right here this blue line is slowly kind
    03:27
    of going up but for the most part it's
    03:28
    kind of stalling whereas productivity is
    03:30
    increasing quite a bit so especially for
    03:34
    middle-class families you see wages are
    03:36
    stopping if you pay attention to 2016
    03:39
    presidential elections this is a major
    03:42
    discussion and there's also an increase
    03:44
    in economic inequality the wealthiest
    03:46
    are getting richer while everybody else
    03:49
    is kind of staying the same so this
    03:50
    growing gap between the rich and the
    03:52
    poor Roman numeral two states the US
    03:54
    population continue to undergo
    03:56
    demographic shifts that had significant
    03:58
    cultural and political consequences
    04:00
    there's a population growth in the south
    04:02
    and the west this is post 1980
    04:04
    continuing there's a continuum post 1980
    04:07
    even though this really began after
    04:09
    World War two this is your Sun Belt
    04:11
    ladies and gentlemen that we have talked
    04:12
    about these states from California all
    04:14
    the way through Texas and Florida and up
    04:17
    to North Carolina and this leads to an
    04:21
    increase influence politically
    04:23
    economically and culturally politically
    04:26
    think about it there
    04:27
    more members in the house these these
    04:29
    states are getting more members in the
    04:31
    house since the population is increasing
    04:33
    economically there are lots of
    04:35
    businesses that are opening up in the
    04:37
    south so you could connect that to the
    04:38
    idea of the new South during the
    04:40
    Reconstruction era there's as I
    04:43
    mentioned more representation in the
    04:45
    house in regards to immigration we see
    04:47
    immigration from Latin America and Asia
    04:48
    that's going to increase drastically
    04:50
    that's a result of that Immigration Act
    04:53
    of 1965 and traditionally these have
    04:55
    been underrepresented groups in American
    04:57
    history remember that 1965 immigration
    05:00
    act overturned the 1921 and 1924 quota
    05:04
    acts and these immigrants have helped
    05:07
    supply the US with an important labor
    05:09
    force
    05:10
    now political debates continued over
    05:12
    immigration policy also over diversity
    05:15
    gender roles and family structures so
    05:18
    the immigration reform a Control Act of
    05:19
    1986 signed by President Reagan this
    05:22
    makes it so a company can be punished
    05:24
    for legally hiring an illegal immigrant
    05:27
    the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy this
    05:30
    banned openly gay individuals from
    05:33
    serving in the military this was put
    05:34
    into place in the 1990s under President
    05:36
    Bill Clinton and this was overturned by
    05:40
    President Barack Obama and here he is
    05:42
    signing the repeal of the Don't Ask
    05:44
    Don't Tell policy in the US military all
    05:49
    right so some test steps will finish up
    05:51
    but for multiple choices short answer
    05:52
    definitely know the impact of technology
    05:54
    be able to identify and describe that
    05:56
    demographic changes the Sun Belt the
    05:58
    Rust Belt that is very very important
    06:00
    it's mentioned several times throughout
    06:01
    the curriculum and the economy since
    06:03
    1980 know there's a decrease in union
    06:04
    membership decrease in manufacturing as
    06:07
    well for essays it will not be
    06:09
    exclusively on this time period but it
    06:11
    could be part of a larger theme such as
    06:13
    immigration post-world War two or the
    06:15
    economy from 1970 to present day all
    06:19
    right as you know we leave one key
    06:21
    concept left it will focus on President
    06:23
    Ronald Reagan's administration so I

    more than a test score
    00:48
    all right key concept 9.3 States the end
    00:51
    of the Cold War and the new challenges
    00:52
    the US leadership in the world forced
    00:54
    the nation to redefine its foreign
    00:57
    policy and global role so it's a big
    00:59
    idea questions how did Ronald Reagan
    01:01
    interact with the Soviet Union in the
    01:03
    1980s and what led to the war on terror
    01:06
    and what were its impacts both
    01:08
    domestically as well as internationally
    01:11
    Roman numeral one states the Reagan
    01:14
    administration promoted an
    01:15
    interventionist foreign policy that
    01:17
    continued in later administrations even
    01:19
    after the end of the Cold War so how did
    01:22
    Reagan assert us opposition to communism
    01:25
    Reagan was a very steadfast
    01:28
    anti-communist leader well he did so in
    01:31
    a couple ways he used speeches and most
    01:33
    famously probably was his mr. Gorbachev
    01:36
    tear down this wall speech in front of
    01:38
    the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and he
    01:40
    also called the Soviet Union an evil
    01:42
    empire so Ronald Reagan was a very good
    01:46
    orator and youth and use this to deliver
    01:48
    the message of and use that to try to
    01:51
    bring about the end of the Cold War we
    01:53
    also have limited military interventions
    01:55
    in the Caribbean for example the u.s.
    01:57
    overthrew the government in Grenada
    02:00
    which was a communist leaning government
    02:02
    so the u.s. is continuing that policy in
    02:05
    Latin America trying to stop communist
    02:07
    governments from coming to in keeping
    02:08
    power and we also have the buildup of
    02:10
    nuclear and conventional weapons ICBMs
    02:12
    which stand for inter
    02:13
    continental ballistic missiles and here
    02:16
    is an ICBM that was developed under
    02:19
    Reagan's administration and its nickname
    02:21
    was the peacemaker you also have the
    02:23
    Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed
    02:25
    Star Wars this was Reagan's plan to
    02:27
    build a satellite defense system in
    02:31
    outer space that would help shoot down a
    02:34
    nuclear missile if it were launched at
    02:36
    the US now this did not come to fruition
    02:37
    but it was a plan so what ultimately
    02:40
    helped contribute to the end of the Cold
    02:42
    War
    02:42
    while we have increased US military
    02:44
    spending as I just mentioned you have
    02:45
    the development of ICBMs and you have
    02:48
    spent a lot of money building up the
    02:49
    military under Reagan which the Soviet
    02:52
    Union had a hard time keeping pace with
    02:53
    we have Reagan's diplomatic initiatives
    02:56
    he had a pretty good relationship with
    02:58
    the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
    03:00
    the two of them work together to help
    03:01
    ease tensions between the US and the
    03:03
    Soviet Union and we also political and
    03:05
    economic issues in Eastern Europe and
    03:07
    the Soviet Union so some factors within
    03:09
    the Soviet Union
    03:10
    Gorbachev's policies of glass' Knost and
    03:13
    perestroika which glass not allowed for
    03:15
    more openness and it was a political
    03:16
    reform in the soviet union and
    03:18
    perestroika were economic reforms so you
    03:20
    see a movement away from communism and
    03:23
    allowing some elements of capitalism so
    03:26
    what were the impacts of the cold of the
    03:28
    end of the Cold War well we have the new
    03:30
    diplomatic relationships the expansion
    03:32
    of NATO the North Atlantic Treaty
    03:34
    Organization which was created to stop
    03:36
    the spread of communism in Europe and
    03:38
    NATO adds several new nations you'll
    03:41
    notice over here in Eastern Europe all
    03:42
    this blue these are NATO nations so NATO
    03:46
    is expanding in Eastern Europe also
    03:49
    peacekeeping interventions whether it
    03:51
    was Iraq in 1991 in the first Gulf War
    03:53
    or bombings in the Federal Republic of
    03:56
    Yugoslavia in the 1990s when a genocide
    03:59
    was happening and and this is a theme
    04:02
    that has continued throughout US history
    04:04
    especially pre and post World War two
    04:06
    there are debates over America's role in
    04:08
    the world like how powerful how involved
    04:10
    should the u.s. be on the world stage
    04:14
    right Roman numeral two states following
    04:16
    the attacks of September 11 2001 u.s.
    04:19
    foreign policy efforts focused on
    04:21
    fighting terrorism around the world so
    04:23
    on September 11th 2001 there were
    04:25
    attacks in Washington DC
    04:27
    Pennsylvania and New York City here's a
    04:30
    famous picture from that Tuesday morning
    04:32
    and Al Queda led the attack on the US
    04:35
    again it's the World Trade Center the
    04:36
    two twin towers in New York City the
    04:39
    Pentagon building in Washington DC and a
    04:41
    plane crashed in Pennsylvania so this
    04:44
    led directly to the conflict in
    04:45
    Afghanistan this was a response to the
    04:48
    Taliban the government of Afghanistan
    04:49
    holding Osama bin Laden and not turning
    04:52
    him over and this led to a lengthy
    04:54
    conflict the conflict in Iraq began two
    04:57
    years later in 2003 and this was a
    05:00
    us-led invasion against Saddam Hussein
    05:03
    in the u.s. under president george w
    05:05
    bush argued that saddam hussein was
    05:08
    suspected of having weapons of mass
    05:09
    destruction and connections to terrorism
    05:12
    it really neither of those has come true
    05:14
    in the years after the fact there have
    05:16
    been no WMDs discovered but that was an
    05:19
    argument used to go in preemptively into
    05:22
    Iraq so what are the impacts of the war
    05:24
    on terrorism well there's a hope to
    05:25
    improve security in the United States
    05:27
    but it also raises questions about
    05:29
    protection of civil liberties and human
    05:31
    rights so as far as civil liberties are
    05:33
    concerned we have the Patriot Act which
    05:35
    which was passed in response to 9/11
    05:38
    this gives the federal government
    05:39
    increased power to wiretap without a
    05:42
    warrant and there's something called a
    05:43
    roving wiretap which focuses on the
    05:46
    person not the device so under a roving
    05:49
    wiretap any device could be tapped
    05:51
    if a suspected individual could use that
    05:54
    device so this increases the
    05:56
    government's ability to wiretap on
    05:59
    individuals and Edward Snowden has been
    06:01
    in the news in recent years he's used to
    06:03
    work for the government and has released
    06:05
    lots of classified documents that shows
    06:08
    that the the US federal government is is
    06:10
    examining phone records and text
    06:13
    messages and emails of citizens that are
    06:16
    not suspected of terrorist connections
    06:18
    as well now there's also debates over
    06:21
    fossil fuels and environmental impacts
    06:23
    and this is caused by conflict in the
    06:25
    Middle East this goes back a long time
    06:27
    but in period 91 1991 the first Gulf War
    06:30
    Iraq invaded Kuwait and there's concern
    06:32
    about the world's oil supply so the US
    06:34
    and the many other countries throughout
    06:37
    the world stepped in to push a rock out
    06:39
    of Kuwait
    06:41
    concerns about climate change in former
    06:43
    Vice President Al Gore created a
    06:44
    documentary called an inconvenient truth
    06:46
    which focuses on the impacts of humans
    06:50
    on the environment this is a major
    06:52
    debate today in politics between the
