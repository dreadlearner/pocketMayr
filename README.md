# pocketMayr
pocketMayr is a command-line application written in Python (compiled with Nuitka https://nuitka.net/), designed to help students in APUSH. It queries notes, youtube videos, wikipedia, vocab, and other resources to find information relevant to given topic.

pocketMayr is a program created as part of my 2020-2021 American Studies class, for the AP US History side. This program takes keywords, and then attempts to search wikipedia, a list of APUSH youtube videos, and the in-class notes/vocab for the given keyword, returning all relevant results. 

Want to run pocketMayr for yourself? Simply download this repository and run 'pocketmayr.exe' in the 'pocketmayr.dist' folder!
