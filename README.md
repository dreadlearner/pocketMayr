# pocketMayr
 APUSH Helper. Queries notes, youtube videos, wikipedia, and other resources to find information relevant to given topic.

pocketMayr is a program created as part of my 2020-2021 American Studies class, for the AP US History side. This program takes keywords, and then attempts to search wikipedia, a list of APUSH youtube videos, the in-class notes/vocab, and a seperate APUSH study website for the given keyword, returning all relevant results.
