New World, New Foods
The Columbian Exchange of foods richly improved the European (and African) diet, not only by improving and diversifying its taste but also, in a more basic sense, by simply increasing Old World societies' abilities to feed more people. 
Starvation, which had long limited population growth in Europe and Africa, was largely overcome through the transplantation of New World foods.

Three staple crops of the Western Hemisphere—corn, potatoes, and cassava—proved to be much more efficient sources of carbohydrates than wheat, the old European standard. An acre of land planted in corn, potatoes, or cassava yielded twice as many calories as an acre planted in wheat, and the increased caloric output of farmers who adopted New World crops helped to fuel a surge in Old World populations. 
In Ireland, for example, widespread peasant farming of the potato allowed the population to soar from barely one million in 1670 to more than 8 million by the time of the infamous Potato Blight of the 1840s. 
Cassava, a tropical root plant, thrived in the impoverished soils of equatorial Africa, helping to support a population boom in the Congo. Although, much of that new population would end up transplanted, involuntarily, to the New World through the Atlantic slave trade.

In the cases of both Irish potatoes and African cassava, New World plants transplanted to Old World societies helped to sustain millions of lives—lives that were later used as reinforcements in the European colonization of the Americas. Whether or not of their own free choice—largely not, in the case of both Irish and Africans—millions of people nourished on American foods would eventually follow in Columbus' footsteps to repopulate a New World whose native inhabitants had been decimated by disease.

At the same time, the colonies the Europeans established in the New World soon became efficient producers of not only New World crops, but Old World transplants as well. So, North America become a key producer of not only corn, but also wheat, while the Caribbean and South America came to host the world's greatest plantations of Old World cash crops like sugar and coffee.

All in all, the Columbian Exchange of foodstuffs vastly increased the health and wealth of Europeans and their colonists in the Americas.

Social hierarchy system in New Spain

Spain’s American Colonies and the Encomienda System
  
By Christopher Minster
Latin American History Expert
http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/theconquestofperu/p/Spain-S-American-Colonies-And-The-Encomienda-System.htm (edited down by Mr. Mayr)

Spain’s American Colonies and the Encomienda System:
In the 1500’s, Spain systematically conquered parts of North, Central and South America as well as the Caribbean. With native governments such as the efficient Inca Empire in ruins, the Spanish conquistadors needed to find a way to rule their new subjects. The encomienda system was put in place in several areas, most importantly in Peru. Under the encomienda system, prominent Spaniards were entrusted with native communities.
Ads
In exchange for native labor and tribute, the Spanish lord would provide protection and education. In reality, however, the encomienda system was thinly-masked slavery and led to some of the worst horrors of the colonial era.
The Encomienda System:
The word encomienda comes from the Spanish word encomendar, "to entrust." The encomienda system had been used in feudal Spain during the reconquest and had survived in some form ever since. In the Americas, the first encomiendas were handed out by Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean. Spanish conquistadors, settlers, priests or colonial officials were given a repartimiento, or grant of land. These lands were often quite vast. The land included any native cities, towns, communities or families that lived there. The natives were supposed to provide tribute, in the form of gold or silver, crops and foodstuffs, animals such as pigs or llamas or anything else the land produced. The natives could also be made to work for a certain amount of time, say on a sugarcane plantation or in a mine.
Ads
In return, the owner, or encomendero, was responsible for the well-being of his subjects and was to see to it that they were converted and educated about Christianity.
A Troublesome System:
The Spanish crown reluctantly approved the granting of encomiendas because it needed to reward the conquistadors and establish a system of governance in the newly-conquered territories, and the encomiendas were a quick-fix that killed both birds with one stone. The system essentially made landed nobility out of men whose only skills were murder, mayhem and torture: the kings hesitated to set up a New World oligarchy which could later prove troublesome. It also swiftly led to abuses: encomenderos made unreasonable demands of the natives who lived on their lands, working them excessively or demanding tribute of crops that could not be grown on the land. These problems appeared quickly. The first New World haciendas, granted in the Caribbean, often had only 50-100 natives and even on such a small scale it wasn’t long before the encomenderos had virtually enslaved their subjects.
Administration of the Encomiendas:
The owners of the encomiendas were not supposed to ever visit the encomienda lands: this was supposed to cut down on abuses. The natives instead brought the tribute to wherever the owner happened to be, generally in the larger cities. The natives were often forced to walk for days with heavy loads to be delivered to their encomendero. The lands were run by cruel overseers and native chieftains who often demanded extra tribute themselves, making the lives of the natives even more miserable. Priests were supposed to live on the encomienda lands, instructing the natives in Catholicism, and often these men became defenders of the people they taught, but just as often they committed abuses of their own, living with native women or demanding tribute of their own.

European Perceptions of Native Americans
By Mary Arnold  |   Submitted On May 02, 2006
Initial European perceptions of Native Americans viewed them as uncivilized savages who, with time and effort, could be educated and assimilated into European culture. Christopher Columbus reported his opinion of the Indians in the following manner:
They should be good servants and of quick intelligence, since I see that they very soon say all that is said to them, and I believe that they would easily be made Christians, for it appears to me that they had no creed. Our Lord willing, at the time of my departure, I will bring back six of them to your Highness, that they may learn to talk (Hurtado 46).
This passage shows that Columbus believed the Indians intelligent and would be easily converted to European ways, but did not think them equal to Europeans. Columbus demonstrates his ethnocentricity by disregarding Native American religious beliefs, and by assuming that because they did not speak a European language they could not "talk."
Europeans viewed the Indians as having inferior cultural practices such as their laws, government, economics, mode of living, religion, property ownership, and education/writing. However, the Europeans believed that these cultural traits of the Native Americans could with little difficulty be changed to resemble European cultures. In 1620, the first college for Native Americans was established to educate Indians in European ways, and in 1640, Harvard opened a college for Indians. This proves that the main objective of the Europeans was to assimilate the Native Americans into European culture by way of education. Europeans justified their conquest of the Indians because they believed they had a divine purpose to convert them to Christianity. Also Europeans believed they could "redeem the savages" in much the same way the Roman Empire had conquered and civilized the rest of Europe.
Indians did not come to be viewed as inherently different in regards to color until the mid-eighteenth century and the label "red" was not used until the mid-nineteenth century. Some causes of the changing perception were an increase of Europeans, bloody conflicts and atrocities, codification of laws designed to control Native peoples, and the view of Europeans began to unify as being "white."
The changing perception of Indians also caused a change in how Europeans dealt with them. In the beginning, Europeans intermarried with them, and used teachers and missionaries to convert them to European culture and religion. Later, education ceased and Europeans moved to subjugate the Indians through displacement on reservations and by war/genocide.

Early Housing: Wattle and Daub Construction
 
From as early as 1607, when settlers began building homes in both the Popham Colony in Maine and Jamestowne in Virginia, they used a construction style known as wattle and daub (1).
To start construction on an average house, which was about 15 feet long by 10 feet wide, the men pounded four small tree posts upright into the ground to erect the four corners. Smaller branches were used to form cross beams. Then they wove thin twigs in and out of the cross beams to create a lathe, called the wattle. Over that lathe, both inside and outside, they daubed, or slapped on, a layer of clay or mud mixed with straw. This daubwas pressed in between the sticks of the wattle like a plaster.
With more medium-sized branches, the planters framed a steep roof, over which they tied layers of bundled thatch [grasses they collected from the marsh swamps]. They covered window openings with oil-soaked paper to keep the cold out and let the light in. The houses were waterproof and snow proof. They were not, however, fireproof. Fire was a constant threat, especially since most of the smaller buildings had no chimneys. The planters needed to build fires to keep warm and to cook. So, sometimes they left a hole in the roof to release the smoke.
The floors remained bare dirt, over which the settlers threw dried grass to warm things up and keep the dust somewhat under control.

The Great Awakening And Enlightenment In Colonial America  

During the late seventeenth and early eighteen centuries, colonial America saw major changes. American cities became important seaports and Southern part of America ended becoming the major contributor to colonial America’s economy. In addition, population increased exponentially with immigrants coming in large numbers and due to the growth of plantations.
It was during this period of economic boom that colonial America experienced two major revivals that had lasting effects on the country with regard to religion, government and human nature. The Enlightenment focused on challenging the role of religion and divine right, and the Great Awakening was responsible in unifying colonies and bringing about the acceptance of religious tolerance.
The Enlightenment in Colonial America

The Enlightenment actually began in Europe and it reached colonial America more than a century later. In Europe, the Enlightenment was responsible for inspiring revived interests in education, science and literature. The advocates of this movement stressed the power of humans to reason so as to promote progress. Some clergy also ended up adopting liberal theology that is known as Rational Christianity. Here the belief was that God gave salvation to everyone and not just a chosen group. The followers of this credence believed that God’s greatest gift to mankind was reason which allowed people to follow the moral teachings of Jesus.
The Enlightenment challenged the role of religion and divine right and this helped Colonial America to see that it was possible to challenge the King and divine right. The movement ended up taking a scientific approach to the world and human nature. The movement challenged the role of God and allowed people to see that they were important and had the ability to shape their own lives. The movement resulted in stimulating new interests in education, science and literature, and as a consequence many new colleges were founded.
The Great Awakening in Colonial America

In the mid 1700s, the colonies saw many spiritual and religious revivals. This led to common views being shared by the North and South and faith was preached across races. Most evangelists ended up condemning slavery as a sin. In fact, at the first general conference of Methodism, it was decreed that having a slave would lead to immediate expulsion.
The movement fulfilled people’s need for reassurance, direction and religious purpose, which otherwise was missing. People united in the understanding of the Christian faith and life. However, the Great Awakening ended up weakening the importance of clergy as believers started relying on their own conclusions. The movement also led to creation of different sects and denominations, and advocated religious tolerance. This movement saw traditional authority of the clergy being challenged and eventually it made it easier to challenge the authority of the King.

Early Housing: Wattle and Daub Construction
 
From as early as 1607, when settlers began building homes in both the Popham Colony in Maine and Jamestowne in Virginia, they used a construction style known as wattle and daub (1).
To start construction on an average house, which was about 15 feet long by 10 feet wide, the men pounded four small tree posts upright into the ground to erect the four corners. Smaller branches were used to form cross beams. Then they wove thin twigs in and out of the cross beams to create a lathe, called the wattle. Over that lathe, both inside and outside, they daubed, or slapped on, a layer of clay or mud mixed with straw. This daubwas pressed in between the sticks of the wattle like a plaster.
With more medium-sized branches, the planters framed a steep roof, over which they tied layers of bundled thatch [grasses they collected from the marsh swamps]. They covered window openings with oil-soaked paper to keep the cold out and let the light in. The houses were waterproof and snow proof. They were not, however, fireproof. Fire was a constant threat, especially since most of the smaller buildings had no chimneys. The planters needed to build fires to keep warm and to cook. So, sometimes they left a hole in the roof to release the smoke.
The floors remained bare dirt, over which the settlers threw dried grass to warm things up and keep the dust somewhat under control.

Declaration of Independence: A Transcription
In Congress, July 4, 1776.
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

The Act for the 
Gradual Abolition of Slavery
by Esther Pavao
Trying to abolish slavery outright was very difficult, and getting a bill passed for the abolition of slavery that was completely unanimous would have been impossible. An act was submitted before Pennsylvania legislature that suggested a gradual freeing of slaves over a span of almost 30 years. It outlined an idea that, if it worked, would have gradually freed slaves and given plantation owners and slaveholders the chance to slowly adapt.
It was monetarily more expedient to buy slaves for life than to pay wages to workers. It saved money and for businessmen, slaves were a very good investment. It would cost approximately $10/day or $3,800 a year to hire a common laborer by one man's estimations. Slaves could cost anywhere from $1,000 upwards for a lifetime of labor. Even if a slave cost $5,000, with two years of labor, he saved his master $2,600. With this in mind, it's a little easier to see why some men fought the abolition of slavery so hard.
It took some time for anything to be passed into law that even began to fight slavery. The Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery was passed by Pennsylvania legislature on March 1, 1780. It was the first act to begin successfully freeing slaves. (Read the full text of the Act here.)
The Act did not attack the rights of slave-owners, and those currently in slavery were not freed by the  Act. In summary:
•	Sections 1 and 2 outline the purpose of the Act.
•	Section three states that all persons born in the state of Pennsylvania after the act was passed are no longer slaves or "lifelong servants of any kind."
•	In Section 4, it goes on to say that even though the children born were not "slaves", they are required to remain in the service of their owners as a type of indentured servant or apprentice until that child is 28 years old. This was an improvement since as indentured servants/apprentices, they had the same privileges, punishments and relief of servitude in case of mistreatment that they did not have hope of as slaves.
•	Section 5 requires all slave-owners to register their slaves annually, names ages, and etc. in order to enforce that the slaves would be freed at age 28 and to keep track of which ones had already been freed. If owners failed to register their slaves, they would have to free them by default.
•	Section 6 reinforces that as soon as the slaves reach 28, owners were required to give them a bill of sale and free them.
•	Section 7 gives slave children (the indentured) the same rights in a court of law as other indentured servants, though as slaves, they were still not allowed to testify against whites.
•	Section 8 promises reimbursement for slave-owners whose slaves were given the death sentence in court, based on the jury's evaluation of the slave's worth.
•	Section 9 covers the punishment for harboring or assisting runaway slaves.
•	Section 10 banned all future slavery and protected every freed man from ever being enslaved again, but excluded visitors to the state or anyone staying less than 6 months. Some people did take advantage of this section by carefully not staying longer than 6 months, leaving, and coming back.
•	Section 11 frees slaves who have run away and been missing for more than 5 years, while allowing owners to recover slaves during this time period.
•	Sections 12 and 13 make longer forms of indentured servitude illegal, regardless of laws in other states.
•	Section 14 repeals any older laws inconsistent with this new law.
Naturally, some people put up quite a fight. Some fought in court. Some just tried to work around it. Some slave-owners moved out of state every six months to exploit the loophole made in Section 10. Some transported pregnant slaves over the state line to have their baby so that it was technically "born into slavery." An amendment was made in 1788 to close this loophole, but it was overrulled as unconstitutional. Far from the 28 years planned, the last slaves in Pennsylvania weren't freed until 1847, 67 years later.
One by one, other states began to adopt the Act. Several states including Massachusetts skipped the gradual and outlawed slavery entirely. The Act, though it didn't work as originally planned, did succeed in legally kick-starting the abolition of slavery.
•	Massachusetts bans slavery all together a few years later

o	Women are treated as 2nd class citizens in 1600s/1700s
	Can’t vote
	Can’t own property
	Can’t sign contracts
	No domestic abuse laws
o	Women cite their help winning American Revolution as reason for deserving larger role in society

•	Impact
o	American women not given many rights in new Constitution when written
	But movement begins discussion
•	And represents beginning of Women’s Rights Movement in America
•	American Revolution Resonates Throughout World
o	Reverberates- ripple effect, vibrations
o	How?
	American Revolution and its Enlightenment ideals inspire other revolutions soon after:
•	French Revolution (1789)
•	Haitian Revolution (1804)
•	Other Latin American Revolutions

A Brief History of Pierre L’Enfant and Washington, D.C.
How one Frenchman’s vision became our capital city
 View of the National Mall (Courtesy of the National Park Service)

Today's Washington, D.C. owes much of its unique design to Pierre Charles L'Enfant, who came to America from France to fight in the Revolutionary War and rose from obscurity to become a trusted city planner for George Washington. L'Enfant designed the city from scratch, envisioning a grand capital of wide avenues, public squares and inspiring buildings in what was then a district of hills, forests, marshes and plantations. by Minute M
The centerpiece of L'Enfant's plan was a great "public walk." Today's National Mall is a wide, straight strip of grass and trees that stretches for two miles, from Capitol Hill to the Potomac River. Smithsonian museums flank both sides and war memorials are embedded among the famous monuments to Lincoln, Washington and Jefferson.
L'Enfant and the Capital
Washington D.C. was established in 1790 when an act of Congress authorized a federal district along the Potomac River, a location offering an easy route to the western frontier (via the Potomac and Ohio River valleys) and conveniently situated between the northern and southern states.
President Washington chose an area of land measuring 100 square miles where the Eastern Branch (today's Anacostia River) met the Potomac just north of Mount Vernon, his Virginia home. The site already contained the lively port towns of Alexandria and Georgetown, but the new nation needed a federal center with space dedicated to government buildings.
Washington asked L'Enfant, by then an established architect, to survey the area and recommend locations for buildings and streets. The Frenchman arrived in Georgetown on a rainy night in March 1791 and immediately got to work. "He had this rolling landscape at the confluence of two great rivers," said Judy Scott Feldman, chairwoman of the National Coalition to Save Our Mall. "He essentially had a clean slate on which to design the city." Inspired by the topography, L'Enfant went beyond a simple survey and envisioned a city where important buildings would occupy strategic places based on changes in elevation and the contours of waterways.
While Thomas Jefferson had already sketched out a small and simple federal town, L'Enfant reported back to the president with a much more ambitious plan. For many, the thought of a metropolis rising out of a rural area seemed impractical for a fledgling nation, but L'Enfant won over an important ally. "Everything he said, a lot of people would have found it crazy back then, but Washington didn't," says L'Enfant biographer Scott Berg.
His design was based on European models translated to American ideals. "The entire city was built around the idea that every citizen was equally important," Berg says. "The Mall was designed as open to all comers, which would have been unheard of in France. It's a very sort of egalitarian idea."
L'Enfant placed Congress on a high point with a commanding view of the Potomac, instead of reserving the grandest spot for the leader's palace as was customary in Europe. Capitol Hill became the center of the city from which diagonal avenues named after the states radiated, cutting across a grid street system. These wide boulevards allowed for easy transportation across town and offered views of important buildings and common squares from great distances. Public squares and parks were evenly dispersed at intersections.
 
 
 
 The MacMillan Commission's plan of Washington, D.C. (Worthy of the Nation: Washington, DC, from L’Enfant to the National Capital Planning Commission)
Pennsylvania Avenue stretched a mile west from the Capitol to the White House, and its use by officials ensured rapid development for the points in between. For the rural area to become a real city, L'Enfant knew it was crucial to incorporate planning strategies encouraging construction. But his refusal to compromise led to frequent clashes that eventually cost him his position.
City commissioners who were concerned with funding the project and appeasing the District's wealthy landowners didn't share L'Enfant's vision. The planner irked the commissioners when he demolished a powerful resident's house to make way for an important avenue and when he delayed producing a map for the sale of city lots (fearing real estate speculators would buy up land and leave the city vacant).
Eventually, the city's surveyor, Andrew Ellicott, produced an engraved map that provided details for lot sales. It was very similar to L'Enfant's plan (with practical changes suggested by officials), but the Frenchman got no credit for it. L'Enfant, now furious, resigned at the urging of Thomas Jefferson. When L'Enfant died in 1825 he had never received payment for his work on the capital and the city was still a backwater (due partly to L'Enfant's rejected development and funding proposals).
Through the 1800s to the McMillan Commission
A century after L'Enfant conceived an elegant capital, Washington was still far from complete.
In the 1800s, cows grazed on the Mall, which was then an irregularly shaped, tree-covered park with winding paths. Trains passing through a railroad station on the Mall interrupted debate in Congress. Visitors ridiculed the city for its idealistic pretensions in a bumpkin setting and there was even talk after the Civil War of moving the capital to Philadelphia or the Midwest.
In 1901, the Senate formed the McMillan Commission, a team of architects and planners who updated the capital based largely on L'Enfant's original framework. They planned an extensive park system, and the Mall was cleared and straightened. Reclaimed land dredged from the river expanded the park to the west and south, making room for the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. The Commission's work finally created the famous green center and plentiful monuments of today's Washington.
L'Enfant and Washington Today
Some of L'Enfant's plans, including a huge waterfall cascading down Capitol Hill, were never realized. But the National Mall has been a great success, used for everything from picnics to protests. "The American people really took to the Mall in the 20th century and turned it into this great civic stage," Feldman says. "That was something that Pierre L'Enfant never envisioned ... a place for us to speak to our national leaders in the spotlight." It has become so popular that officials say it is "terribly overused," as evidenced by worn grass and bare patches of earth.
John Cogbill, chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission which oversees development in the city, says the Commission strives to fulfill L'Enfant's original vision while meeting the demands of a growing region. "We take [L'Enfant's plan] into account for virtually everything we do," he says. "I think he would be pleasantly surprised if he could see the city today. I don't think any city in the world can say that the plan has been followed so carefully as it has been in Washington."

Selected Quotes from George Washington’s Farewell Address
 
Central Idea #1: Avoid Factionalism
“It occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations, Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western; whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection.”
“The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.”



Central Idea #2: Neutrality is Key
“The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred…is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity…which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill-will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy…The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations, has been the victim.”
“So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld.”
“Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns…Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice?”

	Made a series of famous rulings
	Known for redefining Federalism (sharing of state/national power) by expanding power of Federal government
o	Key Cases/Rulings
	Marbury v. Madison (1803)
Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that established the principle of judicial review in the United States, meaning that American courts have the power to strike down laws, statutes, and some government actions that they find to violate the Constitution of the United States.

	McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)
McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that defined the scope of the U.S. Congress's legislative power and how it relates to the powers of American state legislatures. The dispute in McCulloch involved the legality of the national bank and a tax that the state of Maryland imposed on it.

	Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)
Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, was a landmark decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the power to regulate interstate commerce, granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, encompassed the power to regulate navigation.

4.3, II, A-C: The Issue of Slavery 
•	Slavery Spreads West
o	Farmers in Southeast began to run out of arable land
	Largely due to over-cultivation (over-farming)
	So begin to move westward
	Also just desire more land because more land = more crops
o	Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana becoming cotton dominant states
	Forming the “Cotton Belt”
•	South Defends Slavery
o	With slavery expanding, the South begins to defend it more and more
	Virginia lawyer George Fitzhugh quotes:
•	"... the negro race is inferior to the white race, and living in their midst, they would be far outstripped or outwitted in the chaos of free competition." 
•	The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and, in some sense, the freest people in the world.  The children and the aged and infirm work not at all, and yet have all the comforts and necessaries of life provided for them.  They enjoy liberty, because they are oppressed neither by care nor labor.  The women do little hard work, and are protected from the despotism of their husbands by their masters.  The negro men and stout boys work, on the average, in good weather, not more than nine hours a day.
•	We do not know whether free laborers ever sleep.  They are fools to do so; for, whilst they sleep, the wily and watchful capitalist is devising means to ensnare and exploitate them.  The free laborer must work or starve.  He is more of a slave than the negro, because he works longer and harder for less allowance than the slave, and has no holiday, because the cares of life with him begin when its labors end.  He has no liberty, and not a single right. 
o	Southern justifications/arguments for slavery:
	Slavery is a “positive good”
	Slaves are happier than white industrial workers (who have rough conditions themselves)
	Southern economy would collapse without slavery
	North benefits from Southern slavery via massive supply of textiles
	Slave labor is better than wage labor
	Say Bible supported slavery
	Say enslaved people would not survive on their own without slavery 
	Of note
•	Many of these same arguments made about Natives by Spanish
o	Interestingly, most Southerners actually didn’t own slaves (only about 25% owned slaves)
	Most were not wealthy enough to
•	But most Southerners still supported slavery
o	Hope to one day own slaves themselves
o	Fear freed slaves would seek revenge and kill Southern whites
•	North Continues Abolitionist Movements
o	William Lloyd Garrison
o	Frederick Douglass
o	Grimke Sisters
	Grimke Sisters were also noted women’s right leaders of era
•	Women’s Rights Movement and Abolitionism were often closely associated
•	Slavery also soon continues causing political conflict between the North and South:
o	Missouri Compromise
	As Americans move west, new states are forming
•	Will they be free states or slave states?
o	Leads to Missouri Compromise (1820)
	Missouri petitions Congress to be added as new state
•	Would make 13th slave state, but only 12 free states currently
o	Would create imbalance in Congress, so Northern states refuse to approve Missouri’s statehood
	Henry Clay gets everyone to strike a deal
•	Called the Missouri Compromise
o	Missouri added as slave state
o	Maine carved out of Massachusetts as new free state
o	36’30 Line drawn to try to solve future such debates as new states form in Louisiana Territory
•	More North/South Conflict: Nullification Crisis (1828)
o	In 1828, Congress passes another tariff on imports
	Predictably, South is mad
•	Call it “Tariff of Abominations”
o	Vice President (and South Carolina native) John C. Calhoun tries to nullify the tariff
	Says states have the right (called states’ rights) to nullify federal laws
•	Remember when Virginia and Kentucky also suggested this??? ________________________________________________
o	Calhoun also announces he is resigning as Andrew Jackson’s Vice President
	And that South Carolina will be seceding from the Union (creating a new country)
•	Andrew Jackson furious, gets Congress to pass the “Force Bill” to allow him to send troops to stop the secession and force South Carolina to enforce the tariff
o	Civil War nearly starts right here
	Event called Nullification Crisis
o	At last second, Henry Clay negotiates a compromise
	Reducing the tariff in exchange for South Carolina not seceding
o	Bottom line: Civil War averted for now, but North/South tensions are escalating quickly

Clipper ship, classic sailing ship of the 19th century, renowned for its beauty, grace, and speed. Apparently starting from the small, swift coastal packet known as the Baltimore clipper, the true clipper evolved first in American and later in British yards. In its ultimate form it was a long, slim, graceful vessel with projecting bow and radically streamlined hull, carrying an exceptionally large spread of sail on three tall masts. The emphasis on speed came partly from the desire to bring the first tea of the season back from China, partly from the competition with the overland route across North America to the California goldfields. The Flying Cloud, launched in 1851, made the voyage from New York City to San Francisco in a record 89 days, and the James Baines set the transatlantic sailing record of 12 days 6 h from Boston to Liverpool, Eng. The Lightning set the all-time record for a single day’s sail, covering 436 nautical miles in 24 h. The Lightning and the James Baines (both launched in 1854 or 1855), as well as the Flying Cloud, were built by Donald McKay, a Canadian-born shipbuilder, at his shipyard at East Boston, Mass.

	External (international) migrants
•	Continues to be strong
•	Shifting more towards Southern/Eastern Europeans and Asian immigrants
o	Major shift from original “Old” immigrants

	Pullman Strike
•	Another large railroad strike
•	Federal troops had to be called in to break up after violence arose

•	New South
o	Movement to industrialize South in late 1800s
	Leading figure was Henry Grady (Orator of the New South)

I attended a funeral once in Pickens county in my State. This funeral was peculiarly sad. It was a poor “one gallus” fellow, whose breeches struck him under the armpits and hit him at the other end about the knee—he didn’t believe in decollete clothes. They buried him in the midst of a marble quarry: they cut through solid marble to make his grave; and yet a little tombstone they put above him was from Vermont. They buried him in the heart of a pine forest, and yet the pine coffin was imported from Cincinnati. They buried him within touch of an iron mine, and yet the nails in his coffin and the iron in the shovel that dug his grave were imported from Pittsburg. They buried him by the side of the best sheep-grazing country on the earth, and yet the wool in the coffin bands and the coffin bands themselves were brought from the North. The South didn’t furnish a thing on earth for that funeral but the corpse and the hole in the ground. There they put him away and the clods rattled down on his coffin, and they buried him in a New York coat and a Boston pair of shoes and a pair of breeches from Chicago and a shirt from Cincinnati, leaving him nothing to carry into the next world with him to remind him of the country in which he lived, and for which he fought for four years, but the chill of blood in his veins and the marrow in his bones.
	-Henry Grady

	Agriculture will continue to dominate 
•	Based on sharecropping and tenant farming
o	South will not industrialize on large scale until mid-1900s
	And even then only because agriculture industry ran into financial problems

•	Prohibited making statements that would harm military operations, prevent recruitment, or cause insubordination or lack of success for U.S. Army
o	Was loosely defined, and essentially amounted to not being allowed to speak out against war effort
o	Sedition Act

o	Communist countries have very strong central governments that are often oppressive
	Communist countries typically feature a socialist economic setup as well
•	As a result, Socialist Party in America gets bad name for link
•	Additionally, Communists were a party largely of workers who overthrew the elite
o	And called for similar revolutions worldwide
	As a result, Labor Movement also gets associated with Communism
	Red Scare was further propelled by a series of violent domestic events, including several notable bombings blamed on communists and/or anarchists
•	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdbClUYYaOU
