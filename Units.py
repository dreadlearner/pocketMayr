00:04
yo what's going on they push people I
00:06
have a brand new video I key concept 1.1
00:09
this one is made specifically for the
00:12
revisions to the new curriculum so this
00:14
is the most up-to-date video that you
00:17
will find four key concept 1.1 please
00:20
make sure you go to a push review comm
00:22
check out links in the description
00:24
I got links to short answer questions
00:27
everything you need to prepare for this
00:29
test will be found at a push review calm
00:32
before we begin it is shoutout time I'm
00:34
giving a shout out to my boy mr. Martin
00:37
and his class he is right by me in the
00:40
seven one six of Buffalo so thank you
00:43
mr. Martin huge shout out to you in your
00:45
class I appreciate the support and good
00:47
luck to you and your students this year
00:49
alright let's take a look and see what
00:51
key concept 1.1 says as native
00:54
populations migrated and settled across
00:56
the vast expanse of North America over
00:58
time they develop this stink and
01:00
increasingly complex societies by
01:03
adapting to in transforming their
01:05
diverse environments keep in my native
01:07
americans were vastly different from
01:09
tribe to tribe a group to group this one
01:12
is straight out page 25 of the new
01:14
curriculum framework if you don't have
01:15
it download it now will be hugely
01:17
beneficial i got a link to that too in
01:19
the description and the big idea for
01:21
this video is how did natives adapt to
01:24
their environment be sure to be able to
01:27
explain this in case you see it on a
01:29
test
01:30
alright kicad 7 1.1 roman numeral 1 can
01:34
be best described in one word and that
01:36
is maize or corn different native
01:40
societies adapted to and transform their
01:42
environments through innovations in
01:43
agriculture resource use and social
01:46
structure so we're going to talk about
01:47
the impact of maize cultivation or the
01:49
growing of maize so it's very popular in
01:52
the southwest in present-day new mexico
01:55
arizona areas societies developed vast
01:58
irrigation systems to bring water to the
02:00
maize and we see this especially in the
02:02
pueblos near the Rio Grande River so how
02:06
exactly does maize transform societies
02:08
well there's lots of that emphasis on
02:10
hunting and gathering and we see an
02:11
increase in population not only for
02:13
Europeans when maize wakes is what makes
02:15
its way over to Europe but also for
02:18
Native Americans and we see the
02:20
establishment of permanent villages with
02:22
socially diverse societies and these
02:25
permanent develop these permanent
02:27
villages develop because people are
02:29
growing maize and have a constant food
02:31
source an example of a socially
02:33
diversities Tenno chitlin which is
02:36
present-day Mexico City 250,000 people
02:39
live there at its height with many
02:41
different social classes alright let's
02:44
jump on over to the Great Plains and the
02:45
Great Basin here in red is the Great
02:48
Plains and most natives here lived off
02:50
of hunting and gathering there was a
02:52
lack of natural resources with the basin
02:54
which is kind of on the west coast over
02:56
here is a large flat area that was very
02:58
arid or dry and the plains were made up
03:01
of mostly grassland in the introduction
03:05
the horse which will come a little bit
03:06
later from the Spanish with this
03:08
introduction life on the Great Plains
03:10
was drastically altered bison hunting
03:12
became much easier natives with horses
03:14
became stronger militarily so it was a
03:16
huge advantage for natives who had
03:18
horses natives in the Great Basin hunted
03:20
bison and sheep and like natives on the
03:23
Great Plains horses helped natives
03:25
become more powerful for those living in
03:29
the Great Basin as well alright let's
03:32
jump on over to the northeast
03:34
Mississippi River Valley and the
03:35
Atlantic seaboard many societies here
03:38
were a mix of hunting and gathering and
03:40
there is agriculture and and agriculture
03:43
and they developed permanent villages so
03:45
let's take a look at present-day New
03:46
York and Pennsylvania we have the
03:47
Iroquois nation of Native Americans they
03:50
like all many Native Americans adapted
03:52
to their environment they did so by
03:53
burning forests to hunt and grow crops
03:55
and villages were built around maize
03:57
again we see the importance of maize in
03:59
the air koi were matriarchal society
04:01
that means it is a society that has
04:04
power based on female Authority so it is
04:07
based on the mother's side of the family
04:09
not the father's like most European
04:12
families women were instrumental in
04:14
councils and decision making and women
04:16
with tender crops and they oversaw the
04:18
community affairs while the men were off
04:20
hunting so they played a very
04:22
predominant role in society the Cahokia
04:25
India
04:25
their present-day st. Louis which had
04:27
around 30,000 people in 1200 they built
04:30
these giant mounds that could be up to
04:34
about a hundred feet high and this was
04:36
the largest settle community in the
04:39
America in present-day America until New
04:41
York and Philadelphia surpassed them in
04:43
1800
04:44
all right the Northwest present-day
04:46
California we have roughly 300,000
04:48
natives living in California prior to
04:50
the arrival of Columbus and other
04:52
Europeans most of these societies were
04:54
based on hunting gathering and foraging
04:56
they would gather nuts fish and they
04:58
hunted as well these societies tended to
05:00
be ruled by wealthy families we have the
05:02
Chinooks who were a group that advocated
05:06
warrior traditions and they used advance
05:07
fighting techniques and they lived in
05:09
long houses which could you house many
05:12
families and the use canoes as well for
05:14
fishing so let's finish this up with
05:16
some test tips well for multiple choices
05:17
short answer questions you may see
05:19
something like a map of different areas
05:21
of North America how the natives have
05:22
adapted their environment as a questions
05:25
it's not very likely since this is from
05:27
period one although you may although you
05:30
may see something about Native Americans
05:31
that can extend into period two which
05:33
we'll talk about in the period two
05:34
videos all right guys look forward to
05:36
seeing right back here four key concept
05:38
1.2 we'll figure out what this
05:39
technological advancement is played a
05:41
very important role in exploration best

yo yo yo what's up a push beeps we have
00:07
key concept 1.2 for you today this one
00:10
is the most up-to-date video with the
00:12
2015 revisions to the new a push
00:15
curriculum this is the most up-to-date
00:17
video you will find a key concept 1.2
00:20
before we begin it is shout out time a
00:21
huge shout out to miss panade OHS class
00:25
I appreciate your support I got a very
00:27
nice email from you guys I really

00:31
year you are brilliant if you want to
00:33
shout to your teacher and leave requests
00:34
in the comment section below
00:37
alright so let's take a look at this new
00:38
curriculum of ki kasam 1.2 which focuses
00:41
on the Columbian Exchange it states
00:43
contact among Europeans Native Americans
00:45
and Africans resulted in the Columbian
00:47
Exchange and significant social cultural
00:50
and political changes on both sides of
00:52
the Atlantic Ocean check that out on
00:55
page 26 of the framework if you don't
00:57
have it you must download it follow what
00:58
I have a link to it in my in the
01:00
description below now big idea the
01:02
Columbian Exchange revolutionized life
01:05
in the Americas Europe and Africa other
01:07
big idea is to think of it questions are
01:09
what were positives and negatives of the
01:11
Columbian Exchange are both hemispheres
01:12
and what were reasons that led to
01:14
European exploration alright let's take
01:17
a look a key counts of 1.2 Roman numeral
01:19
one it states European expansion into
01:22
the Western Hemisphere generated intense
01:24
social religious political and economic
01:26
competition and changes within European
01:29
societies again that's right from page
01:31
26 so let's explore some reasons for
01:34
European exploration get it Explorer ok
01:38
let's just move on country sought new
01:40
sources of wealth weather was gold and
01:42
or silver but especially gold there also
01:46
was economic and military competition
01:48
this idea of glory and each nation
01:50
wanted to be the best will see that the
01:52
English get involved in period 2 as a
01:54
result of the defeat of the Spanish
01:55
Armada in the late 16th century we see
01:59
the spread of Christianity as a major
02:01
motive particularly when it comes to
02:03
Spain and the Spanish often try to
02:05
convert natives to Christianity they did
02:07
so through the Spanish mission system
02:09
which were outpost throughout the
02:11
Americas to help convert natives and
02:13
they
02:13
off they often were military bases as
02:16
well think of the three G's when it
02:19
comes to European exploration this could
02:20
be a great short answer question briefly
02:22
explain a reason for European
02:25
exploration of the new world think of
02:27
the 3 G's gold glory gospel so you've
02:30
got gold or money glory or fame and the
02:33
gospel religion or God all right so what
02:36
are the impacts of the Columbian
02:37
Exchange well again first of all what is
02:39
the Columbian Exchange is exchange of
02:41
plants animals culture humans diseases
02:43
etc between the Americas Europe and
02:46
Africa so what are some examples of
02:48
goods well from the Americas to Europe
02:50
in Africa we have potatoes and we also
02:54
have maize which we talked about in the
02:56
key concept 1.1 video do you remember
02:59
where maize was mostly cultivated yeah
03:02
that's right your genius in the
03:03
southwest portion of the present United
03:06
States we also have tomatoes and just
03:08
look at that delicious baked potato
03:10
mm-hmm are you butter sour cream person
03:12
I think I'm sour cream but I'm not sure
03:15
all right from Europe to the Americas we
03:17
have things like wheat and rice and
03:19
horses and chickens in oxen lots of
03:22
livestock and perhaps none more
03:24
important for Native Americans than the
03:27
horse going back to key concept one
03:29
point one we're in North America did the
03:32
horse impact in Native Americans yep
03:35
you're right it was the Great Plains and
03:37
the great bison look at you you little
03:39
genius so what are some impacts of the
03:40
exchange well in Europe and Asia we see
03:42
a massive population growth due to new
03:44
food see an increase in wealth and a
03:46
decrease in feudalism and the beginnings
03:49
of the rise of capitalism in Africa we
03:51
see the Spanish and the Portuguese they
03:53
use Africans from West Africa do bees
03:55
use the slaves in the Americas and in
03:57
the Americas we see this spread of
03:59
diseases particularly smallpox and
04:01
measles that killed many Native
04:04
Americans we see the emergence of social
04:06
classes a group like the mestizos which
04:08
are people of mixed Native American and
04:11
European ancestry and also the horse
04:13
transformed Native life by making
04:15
hunting easier on the Great Plains in
04:17
the Great Basin we also then comiendo
04:19
system emerges as well which we're
04:21
talking about just a minute plus I got a
04:23
video for it in the description I got
04:24
you covered
04:25
all right so talk about technology
04:27
and trade there are some reasons why the
04:29
Europeans were able to explore and
04:30
that's because of new technology we have
04:32
this sextant this is a piece of
04:34
technology that could be used to find
04:36
the exact position on earth which led to
04:38
more precise sailing basically this bad
04:41
boy is like the first GPS for ships we
04:46
have the caravel which was a ship
04:48
introduced by the Portuguese that
04:49
allowed for faster travel we have the
04:51
compass and the quadrant which also
04:53
improved saline efficiency when it comes
04:56
to economic improvements think of things
04:58
like the joint stock company which is
05:00
basically a front-runner for the modern
05:03
day corporation which people pool their
05:04
money together and they share the
05:07
profits and losses of a colony and we'll
05:09
see this used in Jamestown which was
05:11
founded by the British in 1607 more on
05:15
that in the next video all right he got
05:17
some one point two Roman numeral two the
05:19
Columbian Exchange and development the
05:21
Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere
05:22
resulted in an extensive demographic
05:25
economic and social changes so what is
05:29
the impact of Spanish exploration well
05:31
again we talked about deadly diseases
05:32
things like smallpox and malaria here is
05:35
a drawing from the Aztec empire of
05:38
people encountering these diseases and
05:40
in some areas that killed as many as 90%
05:42
of Native Americans because they were
05:44
not immune to these European diseases
05:46
again we have their introduction new
05:49
animals and crops that we mentioned
05:50
especially the horse I can't stress that
05:52
enough how important that is for Native
05:54
Americans and also crops food is brought
05:57
over such as wheat rice and sugar which
05:59
will play a prominent role in
06:01
agriculture and cash crops later right
06:05
the encomienda system have more detailed
06:07
video they could check out in the
06:09
description this was when Native
06:10
American labor was marshaled please make
06:13
sure you know this term marshal it is in
06:15
the curriculum you could see it in a
06:17
multiple choice question and if you
06:18
don't know what it is it'll be difficult
06:19
to answer this means to arrange or
06:22
assembled and they Native Americans were
06:24
marshaled on plantations or forced to
06:27
work on plantations the goal was used to
06:29
labor for agriculture and gain precious
06:32
metals like gold and silver from mines
06:35
eventually the in comiendo system is
06:38
going to be replaced by Africa
06:39
slave labor mostly because the live
06:42
Native Americans died but they also run
06:43
away because they know the land the new
06:46
laws of 1542 for example these were
06:48
Spanish laws that outlaw then comme en
06:50
de system now the Spanish and Portuguese
06:52
traders they acquired slaves from West
06:54
African groups and the slaves were used
06:57
by the Spanish on plantations and mines
06:59
so they kind of replace the in comida
07:01
system Spanish caste system emerges and
07:04
this incorporated Europeans Africans and
07:07
natives and we see at the top of the
07:09
Europeans if you took a world history
07:10
class or a global class you remember the
07:12
peninsulares those that were born in
07:14
Spain the Creoles are 100% Spanish that
07:18
were born in the colonies then we see
07:19
groups like mestizos and mulatos and
07:22
mestizos were mixed European and Native
07:24
American and a lot of those were of
07:26
mixed European and African ancestry and
07:29
here is a painting of a mestizo child
07:33
all right eke out some 1.2 Roman numeral
07:36
three and their interactions Europeans
07:38
and Native Americans asserted divergent
07:41
worldviews regarding issues such as
07:42
religion gender roles family land use
07:45
and power there's this misunderstanding
07:47
between each group of each other when it
07:50
comes to gender roles many Native
07:52
American societies as we talked about ki
07:54
kasam 1.1 or matrilineal whereas in
07:57
Europe they're based on the male side or
08:00
the father side of the family land there
08:02
are different concepts of land Europeans
08:05
believed in individual land ownership
08:07
where natives did not they believed in
08:08
it in terms of a community it belonged
08:10
to everybody
08:11
religion native Native Americans tended
08:14
to believe in animism or this belief is
08:15
spirits in nature and they also tend to
08:17
be polytheistic and shamans or medicine
08:20
men held tremendous power all of those
08:22
rank contradictory to Christianity which
08:25
was practiced by Europeans there were
08:29
some usable useful aspects of each
08:31
other's cultures that were eventually
08:32
adapted natives adapted various
08:34
technology things like horses things
08:37
like guns and horses as well although
08:39
that's not technology and Europeans
08:41
adapted agricultural techniques from
08:44
Native Americans native resistance to
08:47
European encroachment and labour
08:49
occurred and encroachment means kind of
08:51
like coming
08:51
onto somebody's land or somebody's space
08:54
and natives sought to preserve political
08:56
economic and religious autonomy
08:58
everybody do me a favor and make sure
09:00
you know this word autonomy for using
09:03
the fill-in-the-blank guide for this
09:04
video circle and right now my students
09:06
circle it this means independence or
09:08
self-rule in America today people become
09:12
autonomous when they're 18 years old
09:14
when they're legally adults and they try
09:17
to do so diplomatically and or
09:18
militarily and there were debates over
09:20
how non-european should be treated how
09:23
should Africans and natives be treated
09:26
by Europeans well many Europeans all
09:28
natives and Africans as savages as less
09:31
than human one discipline ADA he was
09:35
this guy that advocated harsh treatment
09:36
of the natives and he claimed that
09:37
slavery for natives was justified under
09:40
Christianity on the opposite end you
09:42
have this do Bartolome de las casas and
09:44
he argued that the natives deserved the
09:46
same treatment as all other men and he
09:48
played an instrumental role in the
09:50
ending of encomienda system and
09:51
contributed to this idea the black
09:53
legend that the Spanish really
09:55
contributed to a lot of destruction of
09:57
Native American society and what were
10:00
arguments used to subjugate Africans and
10:02
natives well we have racism we we have
10:04
religious reasons and also this idea
10:06
that natives and Africans were seen as
10:08
barbaric or savages all right we'll
10:10
finish up with some tests tips for
10:11
multiple choice and short answer be
10:13
familiar with the impacts of the
10:14
Columbian Exchange not just food think
10:17
about disease - you've increased some
10:19
World Trade firmly connecting two
10:20
hemispheres be able to identify specific
10:23
Goods and their impacts what comes to
10:25
mind right away from me is the horse the
10:27
impact the horse had on Native Americans
10:29
impact the potato head on Europe and
10:32
also then comiendo system as well impact
10:35
on Africans we see drastic growth in
10:38
slavery which we'll talk about more in
10:39
key concept 2.1 and four essay questions
10:42
European interactions with Native
10:44
Americans and we'll talk more about that
10:46
in period two again you will not see an
10:48
essay exclusively from period one it
10:49
would be a combination of period 1 & 2
10:51
this could also be a part of a larger
10:53
topic comparing Spanish colonization
10:55
with other European countries which we
10:59
will talk about the English and the
11:00
French in the next video I thank you
11:02
guys very much for watching we'll figure
11:04
out who this do
11:04
is bacon in what his beef is why are he

in a pushin this is specifically

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,480
mentioned in the new apush curriculum so

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,400
this is definitely something you should

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,320
be familiar with if you would like the

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,720

take you to a plush review calm where

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,630
you can download it alright let's talk

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,750
about the new curriculum inin comme un

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,880
des welke cards have 1.2 Roman numeral 1

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,969
letter D States in the economies of the

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,760
Spanish colonies ending labor using the

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,620
encomienda system to support validation

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,500
based agriculture and extract precious

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,930
metals and other resources was gradually

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,719
replaced by African slavery this is from

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,700
page 24 of the new curriculum framework

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,230
so since then commando system is

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,969
specifically mentioned in the framework

24
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,219
there is a good chance that you will be

25
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,440
directly assessed on it let's get going

26
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,510
and talking about what exactly is this

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,309
and comiendo system well background in

28
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,010
front this takes place in the early 16th

29
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,130
century so talking about the early 1500s

30
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,740
here and this was a Spanish system of

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,560
control over natives and much of the

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,470
Americas and we have this guy Nicolas de

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,659
ovando who's really kind of the creator

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,970
of this so what did it do well they were

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,610
royal grants of land from the Spanish

36
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,070
crown to various Spaniards and and

37
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,680
return for receiving these royal grants

38
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,350
of land the splint Spanish promised to

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,240
Christianize the natives living on the

40
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,119
lands they promised to convert them to

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,920
Christianity the Spanish also gained

42
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,020
tribute from the natives which was a

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
form of payment whether it was in labor

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,570
or actual payment so how were the

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,840
natives affected by this they most of

46
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,030
them were treated very harshly and they

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,520
would do heavy manual labor such as

48
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,790
building roads and infrastructure it was

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,130
very hard work for natives to do the in

50
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,500
command Eze became wealthy due to the

51
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,170
discovery of gold and silver and spain

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,390
discovered an insane amount of gold and

53
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,690
silver in the Americas and they became

54
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,640
very very very wealthy alright so why

55
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,890
does this a command a system fall apart

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,140
well many Catholics began to approach

57
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,750
test the harsh treatment of the natives

58
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,990
including this guy Bartolome de la Casas

59
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,790
he was very influential and urged that

60
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,360
Native Americans should be treated more

61
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,420
fairly and equally we also have mestizos

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,730
which are individuals who are of Spanish

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,700
and Native American ancestry and here is

64
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,770
a picture of a mestizo baby there were

65
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,900
laws that were made that that mestizos

66
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,880
could not be forced to work and then Co

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,239
me in the system so as time went on more

68
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,670
and more mestizos were being born and

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,950
thus less people were available to work

70
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,690
and then Co me in the system and in time

71
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,560
this helped lead to the decline of the

72
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,930
in communist gradually the system was

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,720
replaced by African slave labor like

74
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,519
many area up like many areas of the

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,530
America and another big reason was the

76
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,019
Africans were more immune to European

77
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,080
diseases than were natives once

78
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,850
Europeans reach the Americas a

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,000
significant majority of Native American

80
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,100
populations were reduced due to disease

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,600
alright let's go over some test tips

82
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,950
multiple choice questions in short

83
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,829
answer definitely know that they've

84
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,170
comiendo system was Indian slave labor

85
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,090
by another name it was it was

86
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,190
essentially slavery even though it was

87
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,200
called in Commandos and this is

88
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,690
gradually replaced by African slave

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,310
labor as we just talked about as a

90
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,140
questions you are not likely to see

91
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,760
instances from the first time period if

92
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,769
you do see something from the first time

93
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,870
period it will be asked in conjunction

94
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,450
with another time period so you will not

95
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,329
see something solely from the first time

96
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,470
period in Si alright thank you guys very

97
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,090

00:03
hey what's going on and push people we
00:06
have key concept 2.1 for you today this
00:09
one is from period 2 and is updated for
00:11
the 2015 revision so this is the most
00:14
up-to-date video you will find on key
00:17
concept 2.1 alright let's take a look
00:19
and see what it says it says europeans
00:21
developed a variety of colonisation and
00:23
migration patterns influenced by
00:25
different imperial goals cultures and
00:27
the varied North American environments
00:29
where they settled and they competed
00:33
with each other and American Indians for
00:36
resources this is front page 30 of the
00:38
curriculum framework so big idea
00:40
questions to think about as you watch
00:41
this video what were similarities in
00:43
colonization among the Spanish French
00:45
Dutch and English
00:47
what were the experiences like with
00:49
Native Americans with these European
00:50
countries how and why did slavery evolve
00:53
in these colonies and how did climate in
00:55
geography affect British colonies
00:57
alright let's take a look at Roman
00:59
numeral 1 it it states Spanish French
01:02
Dutch and British colonizers had
01:03
different economic and imperial goals
01:06
involving land and labour that shaped
01:08
the social and political development of
01:10
their colonies as well as their
01:12
relationships with native populations
01:14
this is screening to me a short answer
01:17
or an essay topic about comparing and
01:19
contrasting these different European
01:22
imperial goals
01:24
alright so letter A Spain establish
01:26
strict control over colonization and
01:28
they converted and Exploited many Native
01:31
Americans and a major goal of Spain was
01:35
to make money or gold from the three
01:37
geez we talked about in the first key
01:39
concept all trade must go through a few
01:42
Spanish controlled port so they really
01:44
had their hand firmly around the
01:47
economies of these colonies a small
01:50
amount of Spaniards ruled the indigenous
01:51
population and we'll compare that later
01:53
with English which sent a lot of people
01:55
and the Spain sought to convert natives
01:57
to Christianity and they forced money
01:59
into the in comiendo system and they use
02:02
the natives as trading partners now
02:04
remember we talked about that comiendo
02:05
system in the last video and this was
02:07
basically slavery for the Native
02:09
Americans now when we're talking about
02:10
French and Dutch colonization but
02:13
of those countries sent few Europeans
02:14
and they built relationships with the
02:16
natives
02:17
the French often intermarried with the
02:19
natives and they built extensive trading
02:21
partnership so really they had pretty
02:23
good relations with the natives Cober de
02:26
bois were these French fur traders and
02:28
they would trade beaver furs and they
02:29
would live among the natives they had
02:32
friendly relations with the natives the
02:34
Dutch like the French the Dutch built
02:36
extensive trade routes mostly in
02:38
present-day New York in near New York
02:41
City and they encouraged settlement of
02:43
the new world through New Netherland
02:45
Rhys talked about English colonization
02:48
the most different from all the European
02:51
powers they sent a large number of
02:52
immigrants both male and female
02:55
unlike other European countries
02:58
everybody do me a favor and circle male
02:59
and female that's an important thing to
03:01
know wasn't just men that were sent over
03:03
it they were females as well the English
03:06
saw economic prosperity they want to
03:08
religious freedom especially for those
03:10
Puritans they want to be able to
03:11
practice the religion without
03:12
persecution and they wanted better
03:14
living conditions England was very
03:16
overcrowded during this time the English
03:19
colonies also welcomed immigrants from
03:21
other countries and the counties were
03:23
based on agriculture including the New
03:26
England colonies tobacco became a major
03:28
major cash crop for the English colonies
03:31
and brought a lot of wealth the
03:33
headright system encouraged immigrants
03:35
in the head rate system would benefit
03:37
the wealthy because every person who
03:39
paid for an indentured servant to come
03:40
to the new world would gain 50 acres of
03:42
land now unlike the French of the
03:45
Spanish the English colonists ought to
03:46
live separately from native americans
03:48
again the French and the Spanish with
03:50
intermarry with the natives they would
03:52
have trade alliances with them but the
03:53
English really lived entirely separate
03:56
from the Native Americans in there
03:59
emerges conflicts with Native Americans
04:00
such as the Powhatan zhh Bacon's
04:02
Rebellion which was a rebellion of many
04:05
former detchard servants who were upset
04:07
about a lack of protection on the
04:09
frontier in Jamestown Virginia from
04:11
Native Americans the Pequot War and also
04:14
Kings felt King Phillip's war in New
04:16
England which I do have a video on check
04:18
the description for that alright let's
04:21
take a look at Roman numeral tuinal in
04:23
the 17th century early British colonies
04:25
developed along the
04:25
Lanta coast with regional differences
04:27
that reflected various environmental
04:30
economic cultural and demographic
04:31
factors so we're really going to get
04:33
into the makeup of the British colonies
04:36
well the Chesapeake colonies please know
04:38
this this is specific to two colonies
04:41
Maryland and Virginia when we're talking
04:43
about the Chesapeake colonies and we're
04:45
talking about North Carolina they're
04:46
going to really heavily focus on tobacco
04:49
and as a result plantations will develop
04:51
that really do nothing but grow tobacco
04:54
and this will lead to long workdays and
04:56
growing seasons as well
04:58
tobacco exhausts land and this will lead
05:02
to expansion and then conflicts with
05:04
natives that are living on this land so
05:06
again the more the colonists expand the
05:09
more they're going to encroach on Native
05:10
American land and lead to expansion so
05:12
again that idea of Baker's rebellion
05:14
that we're talking about English
05:15
colonists in Jamestown were upset that
05:17
they felt they did not have adequate
05:19
protection from the governor of Virginia
05:21
against the natives up to the 17th
05:24
century so most of the 1600s most of the
05:27
labor was made up of the indent of
05:29
indentured servants now after Bacon's
05:31
Rebellion which was made up of mostly in
05:33
Dutchess servants plantation owners
05:34
begin to move away from it entered
05:36
servants because they eventually get the
05:38
freedom in watt land and there was a
05:40
switch more towards African slavery so
05:42
if you're writing a short answer and
05:43
essay topic about the growth of slavery
05:45
you can absolutely talk about a shortage
05:48
of indentured servants or a conflict
05:50
like Bacon's Rebellion
05:51
now let's jump up to the New England
05:52
colonies in the north they were
05:54
established by Puritans these were
05:55
people who wanted to purify the Anglican
05:57
Church not break away from it dudes like
05:59
this guy John Winthrop and they
06:01
established small towns with small farms
06:03
schools were established for towns with
06:06
50 families and that was important to
06:08
instill reading and writing so people
06:10
could reach so children could grow up to
06:11
read the Bible and extended families
06:13
were much more common in New England
06:15
than they were in the middle colonies or
06:17
the south there was some agriculture
06:19
also fishing and commerce in Boston in
06:22
particular is going to become a major
06:23
port city for trade there's a colder
06:26
climate and the rocky terrain did not
06:28
allow for large plantations that you see
06:30
in the south with a very flat to warm
06:33
long growing seasons
06:34
alright the middle colonies these tended
06:36
to be the most diverse demographically
06:38
religiously
06:39
ethnically out of all the colonies with
06:41
the Quakers in Pennsylvania which was
06:43
established by William Penn they were
06:45
very religiously tolerant women in
06:47
Pennsylvania had more rights than other
06:49
counties the Quakers allowed women equal
06:51
positions in church and they were
06:53
allowed to speak in church ceremonies as
06:55
well and they also had more immigrants
06:57
from other countries besides just
06:59
England immigrants came from what is
07:01
present-day Germany as well the economy
07:04
was based on the exportation of cereal
07:06
crops such as wheat so lots of
07:07
Agriculture happening there now let's go
07:10
down to the southern colonies places
07:11
like South Carolina and Georgia and then
07:13
in the Caribbean we're going to see rice
07:15
as a major staple crop this is very
07:18
arduous labor there are incredibly long
07:20
days and a long growing seasons there
07:23
would be lots of disease as well from
07:25
the swamps and mosquitos that would
07:27
carry diseases many white laborers
07:29
refused to work in these rice fields
07:32
which would lead to an increase in slave
07:34
labor in this area in the West Indies
07:38
and Barbados in particular you see sugar
07:40
cultivation which is a major part of the
07:41
economy and like South Carolina and
07:44
Georgia slave labor was heavily used in
07:46
the Caribbean and in many instances in
07:48
the West Indies slaves made up a
07:50
majority of the population and this is
07:52
going to lead to the development of
07:54
really strict slave codes or laws to
07:57
regulate slave behavior these laws would
08:00
give incredible power to slave owners
08:02
the emergent there became an emergence
08:05
of a democratic self-government in the
08:07
British colonies and we'll find our line
08:08
this is really this was really caused by
08:10
distance from Brent since the colonies
08:12
were so far away Britain really didn't
08:14
have as much control and there was lacks
08:17
attention or this idea known as salutary
08:19
neglect and Britain really kind of takes
08:21
a hands-off approach to the colonies as
08:23
long as they're you know making money
08:25
and being peaceful and not really going
08:26
against British ideals we see in New
08:29
England the development of colonial
08:31
government through town meetings and
08:32
these people would be able to elect
08:34
legislators and the people who could
08:36
vote we're limited at the time to white
08:39
land owning church members but it really
08:41
was an incredible form of democracy for
08:43
its time in the south we see planners
08:46
dominating assemblies things like the
08:48
Virginia House of Burgesses here's a
08:49
replica here you can go to Colonial
08:51
Williamsburg
08:52
and actually step foot in this room this
08:54
was the first representative government
08:56
in the British colonies and many of its
08:58
members were elite plantation owners and
09:01
that if you were to look at the last
09:04
names of members you'll see famous names
09:06
like Jefferson Thomas Jefferson's father
09:09
was a member of the House of Burgesses
09:11
alright we'll finish up jumping over the
09:18
key concept to point one Roman numeral
09:20
three competition over resources between
09:22
European rivals and American Indians
09:23
encouraged industry and trade that led
09:26
to conflict in the America so the land
09:28
economy emerges this is exchange of
09:31
goods African Americans and Native
09:34
Americans between Europe Africa and the
09:36
Americas and this really is the
09:39
Columbian Exchange the continuation of
09:41
the Columbian Exchange we talked about
09:42
in period one European colonies focused
09:45
on producing goods to Europe this is
09:47
mercantilism the idea that colonies
09:49
produced goods for the mother country
09:51
and goods that were valued in Europe
09:53
were exported from the colony
09:54
specifically items like fur and tobacco
09:57
this helps lead to new sources of labor
10:00
initially it was Native American labor
10:01
then it was replaced by with indentured
10:04
servant labor and then finally African
10:06
slave labor so what is impact the
10:08
impacts of trade on natives well we have
10:10
cultural changes the natives lost many
10:12
land the natives lost much of their land
10:14
and many Europeans ought to assimilate
10:17
Native Americans we have economic
10:19
changes as well land was lost and
10:21
altered by Europeans and their way of
10:22
life was shifted as a result of this
10:25
loss of land demographic changes is what
10:28
we've talked about the the impact of
10:31
disease on decreasing the population for
10:34
Native Americans interactions between
10:36
Native Americans and Europeans on this
10:39
term fostered is used in the curriculum
10:41
please make sure you know this it means
10:42
to promote the growth of so interactions
10:45
fostered both accommodation and conflict
10:48
and Europeans allied with native groups
10:51
against opposing native groups and we
10:53
see this in the Pequot War meta comms
10:55
war or King Philip's War in which
10:57
Europeans would kind of a lot allied
11:00
themselves with one group of Native
11:01
Americans against their enemies and the
11:03
British raid will offer more Goods than
11:05
natives whereas the
11:06
were more tolerant of natives again
11:09
going back to the idea of intermarrying
11:10
with them so it's kind of a trade-off
11:12
for Native Americans with who they want
11:14
to ally with during the French and
11:16
Indian War which we'll talk about more
11:17
in Period three almost all natives were
11:21
allied with the French except for the
11:23
Iroquois Native Americans and European
11:26
colonial interests are often going to
11:28
vary or they will have different
11:30
interest in what they hope to hit and
11:33
they will often have different goals and
11:36
interests both sides increasingly began
11:38
to distrust each other as time went on
11:40
British colonists sought to expand they
11:42
wanted more land whereas Britain really
11:44
pushed to contain the colonists due to
11:47
conflict with Native Americans and we'll
11:49
see this especially in 1763 with this
11:51
line here the proclamation line of 1763
11:54
which will forbid expansion past the
11:57
Appalachian Mountains and frontier
11:59
defense became a major issue again seen
12:02
in Bacon's Rebellion I've talked about
12:04
that several times now this idea of
12:06
colonists wanting protection from Native
12:08
Americans on the outskirts of towns or
12:11
cities and trade also divided the two
12:13
groups colonists smuggled to get around
12:16
British taxes alright British and Native
12:20
American conflicts were caused by
12:21
competition over land resources and
12:23
boundaries and this would lead to
12:25
military conflicts specifically
12:27
medicham's war King Philip's War again I
12:28
have a video in the description to check
12:30
out this was a conflict between natives
12:32
and British colonists in New England the
12:34
natives were defeated and really from
12:36
that moment forward in New England they
12:38
were not much of a threat to the
12:39
colonists the Spanish and Native
12:41
American it comes to Spanish and Native
12:43
American resistance we see the Pueblo
12:45
Revolt in New Mexico present-day New
12:47
Mexico the Pueblo Indians successfully
12:49
overthrew the Spanish for twelve years
12:51
and after the Spanish regained control
12:53
they became much more accommodating to
12:55
Native American culture particularly
12:56
religion so even though the Spanish
12:58
regained control they become much more
13:01
accommodating or accepting of Native
13:03
Americans alright let's finish up with
13:06
some tests tips from multiple choice and
13:08
short answer questions be able to
13:10
identify and explain goals of European
13:12
colonization the differences between the
13:14
British and other colonies and comparing
13:16
British colonies to other British
13:19
colonies so for
13:20
New England to the Chesapeake how do
13:22
they differ and hardly similar
13:24
geographically religion religiously and
13:26
economically for essay questions you
13:29
could see something along lines of the
13:30
reasons for the development of slavery
13:32
and comparing and contrasting European
13:34
colonization French Spanish and English
13:36
and I do have a detailed video on that
13:38
as well we're actually break it down as
13:40
to how could be how there could be an
13:43
essay on it check the description for
13:44
that as well
13:45
alright guys look forward to seeing you
13:47
right back here four key concepts 2.2
13:49
we'll figure out who this dude is

        """
    class video2:
        url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVy_9FhVfKE'
        title = 'APUSH Review: Key Concept 2.2, Revised (Most up-to-date video)'
        captions = """
00:04
hey what's up a push peeps this is your
00:06
boy Adam Norris here with kicad said two
00:09
point two for you today this one is
00:10
updated the most up-to-date video you
00:13
will find a key concept to point to
00:15
alright let's take a look and see what
00:16
it says
00:17
the British counties participated in
00:19
political cultural and economic
00:21
exchanges with Great Britain that
00:23
encouraged both stronger bonds with
00:25
Britain and resistance to Britain's
00:28
control I don't know about you that is
00:30
screaming to meet changing continuity
00:33
that is something that aap really wants
00:35
you to understand what changed during a
00:37
time period in what remained the same so
00:40
the countess and Great Britain
00:42
encouraged stronger bonds so exchanges
00:44
encourage stronger bonds that's going to
00:46
be the continuity but it also encouraged
00:49
resistance and that's going to be the
00:51
change so keep that in mind as we watch
00:53
this video so some big ideas how did the
00:56
colonists begin to develop an identity
00:58
during this time what impacted religion
01:01
have on the colonies and why did slavery
01:03
develop in the British colonies you
01:05
should know that already a little bit at
01:07
least from key cuts of 2.1 with Bacon's
01:10
Rebellion and furthermore how did
01:12
Africans resist their conditions okay
01:15
let's take a look at 2.2 Roman numeral
01:17
one transatlantic commercial religious
01:19
philosophical and political exchanges
01:21
led residents of the British colonies to
01:24
evolve in their political and cultural
01:25
attitudes as they became increasingly
01:27
tied to Britain and one another so we're
01:30
going to see more interdependence here
01:32
among the colonies and Britain so we see
01:35
the emergence of diverse religious and
01:37
ethnic groups Catholics especially in
01:39
Maryland with the Maryland acts of
01:40
toleration which granted religious
01:42
tolerance to Christians only and it was
01:45
aimed at protecting Catholics the
01:47
Quakers of Pennsylvania and Puritans
01:49
in New England so we've lured Baltimore
01:51
who is the famous Catholic William Penn
01:54
the Quaker and John Winthrop the Puritan
01:57
so pluralism what is pluralism well it's
01:59
this idea that multiple groups are
02:01
existing together at the same time it
02:04
will also lead to intellectual exchange
02:07
from different European groups so not
02:09
just England will ideas be coming from
02:11
in regards to Europe but also
02:13
other areas the areas of present-day
02:16
Germany as well Pennsylvania will see a
02:19
lot of immigrants coming from that area
02:22
now these diverse religious and ethnic
02:25
groups are going to strain are going to
02:26
be strengthened by the first Great
02:28
Awakening people like this dude George
02:30
Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards who
02:32
happen to be the grandfather to vice
02:34
president Aaron Burr who shot and killed
02:37
Alexander Hamilton in 1804 now this is
02:40
going to lead to increase in conversions
02:43
of first Great Awakening and new
02:45
branches of Christianity as well I have
02:47
a video in the description that goes a
02:48
much more detail with of than about the
02:51
first Great Awakening but the big idea
02:53
people are being brought back to
02:55
religion and more conversions and new
02:58
branches of Christianity this will lead
03:00
to questioning of authority also the
03:03
Enlightenment is occurring in Europe and
03:04
this leads to the questioning of
03:06
government people like John Locke right
03:09
about natural rights life liberty and
03:11
property and Montesquieu writes about
03:13
separation of powers why know how I
03:14
remember Montesquieu Montesquieu that's
03:17
three syllables separation of powers
03:19
three words so let it be how do the
03:23
British counties experience
03:25
anglicisation everybody circle for me
03:27
Anglican especially my students this
03:29
means using more English norms and
03:31
customs this is going to happen over
03:33
time well it does so by colonial
03:35
governments were based on English model
03:37
so the government structure is based on
03:39
England
03:40
what frequent contact with Britain via
03:42
the transatlantic print cultures so
03:44
ideas are being spread from England all
03:47
the way over to the Americas especially
03:50
via trade in newspapers and we're going
03:52
to have the spread of Protestant
03:54
evangelism again this idea of the first
03:57
Great Awakening George Whitefield he's
03:59
originally from England he and others
04:01
come across the Atlantic to the colonies
04:03
to spread their message and encourage
04:06
conversion in new branches of
04:08
Christianity the British sought to
04:10
increase control of its colonies through
04:11
its pursuit of mercantilism and
04:13
mercantilism is important to know it's
04:15
the idea that the colonies exist for the
04:17
benefit of the mother country and when
04:20
there were conflicts with colonists and
04:21
natives this would lead to erratic or
04:23
inconsistent enforcement Britain sought
04:27
to
04:27
make colonial expansion to limit
04:29
conflict with natives and we'll see this
04:31
especially after 1763 at the end of the
04:35
Seven Years War the French in nur also
04:37
the navigation axes require colonists to
04:40
export specific Goods only to England
04:42
like tobacco or English colonies and
04:45
whether it was tobacco or for other
04:47
goods that the colonists were only
04:49
expected to trade with Britain and its
04:51
colonies and the colonists will
04:53
eventually try to get around this and
04:55
they will do so by smuggling the
04:58
dominion of New England could buy
04:59
Massachusetts with the rest of New
05:00
England and later New Jersey in New York
05:02
and this was a way for England to try to
05:04
gain more control over the colonies and
05:07
assemblies were eliminated and a new
05:09
governor was appointed Sir Edmund Andros
05:12
he was incredibly unpopular he
05:14
eventually is going to be overthrown
05:16
he's going to try to escape America by
05:18
dressing as a woman but he is caught so
05:21
these are different attempts of britain
05:24
tried to increase control of its
05:26
colonies via mercantilism colonial
05:29
resistance to the British stemmed from a
05:31
bunch of different ideas including
05:33
colonial self-government the idea the
05:35
colonists mostly white land owning men
05:37
in most cases were able to vote for
05:39
colonial represent representatives
05:41
however they had no say in Parliament so
05:44
colonists could not vote for members of
05:46
parliament ideas of Liberty again from
05:48
the Enlightenment time period these
05:50
ideas are very popular in colonists all
05:52
themselves as British and wanted the
05:54
same rights as their British
05:55
counterparts the Enlightenment
05:57
challenged traditional ideas of
05:58
government this would encourage limiting
06:00
the power of government whether it's due
06:02
checks and balances or different ways of
06:06
limiting the power of a central
06:08
government religious independence and
06:11
diversity is also occurring in the first
06:13
Great Awakening challenge traditional
06:15
Church Authority and this would lead to
06:17
challenging of authority in other areas
06:19
as well especially the government so
06:21
some people argue the first Great
06:22
Awakening is kind of a forerunner to the
06:25
American Revolution
06:26
there's also perceived corruption in the
06:29
Imperial system or in the Imperial
06:31
government so corrupt rulers like Sir
06:33
Edmund Andros in the Dominion of England
06:35
that we just talked about he eliminated
06:37
colonial assembly so there's this idea
06:39
that you know maybe these peep
06:41
who are in charge in government are kind
06:43
of corrupted and don't have the colonial
06:45
best interests at heart and there is Sir
06:49
Edmund Andros kicad some 2.2 Roman
06:52
numeral - like other European empires in
06:54
the Americas that participate in the
06:56
Atlantic slave trade the English
06:57
colonies developed a system of slavery
06:59
that reflected the specific economic
07:01
demographic and geographic
07:03
characteristics of those colonies so why
07:07
did all the British colonies participate
07:09
in the slave trade to some degree it's
07:10
not just the south initially that
07:12
participates there's large amounts of
07:14
farmland everywhere and there's a high
07:16
demand in Europe for colonial Goods
07:19
again tobacco I can't stress enough how
07:20
important tobacco was there was a very
07:22
large market for it an opportunity for
07:25
people to make lots of money there's
07:26
also a shortage of a duchard servants
07:28
especially after Bacon's Rebellion in
07:31
1676 and that's really going to make
07:34
many plantation owners want a more
07:37
permanent source of labour so where was
07:40
slavery found in the British colonies I
07:41
just mentioned it was found pretty much
07:43
everywhere well in New England small
07:45
farms had some slaves port cities and
07:48
the north and the south would have
07:49
slaves that would be working so any
07:51
cities that were involved heavily in
07:52
trade and plantations especially in the
07:55
Chesapeake which is Maryland in Virginia
07:57
don't forget and the south areas like
07:59
North Carolina South Carolina and
08:01
Georgia now most of the slaves were
08:04
living in the south but they were but
08:06
there were some in all the British
08:09
colonies and most African slaves were
08:11
sent to the Caribbean to the West Indies
08:14
to work on sugar plantations so what's
08:18
the impact of slavery in the south while
08:20
we have the emergence of a strict racial
08:22
system there's prohibition of
08:24
interracial interracial relationships
08:26
again you can contrast that with the
08:28
Spanish colonies where the British did
08:30
not really allow interracial
08:32
relationships whereas the Spanish
08:35
colonies dead children are mothers at
08:38
were slaves were enslaved so it didn't
08:39
matter who the father was the mother was
08:42
a slave her children would automatically
08:45
be slave so that helped to find who
08:47
slaves were African's resisted slavery
08:49
and sought to maintain some levels of
08:51
autonomy again autonomy means like self
08:54
ruler and
08:55
and they did so through family culture
08:57
and religion we're also going to talk
08:59
about how Africans resisted slavery so
09:01
they did so overtly through rebellion a
09:04
famous rebellion in 1739 just outside of
09:07
Charleston South Carolina was a Stono
09:09
rebellion in which slaves revolted that
09:12
killed many whites and they tried to
09:13
flee to Spanish held Florida
09:16
they also rebelled or revolt resisted
09:19
slavery covertly doing things more
09:21
discreetly like breaking tools running
09:23
away working slowly faking illness and
09:26
Africans maintained levels of autonomy
09:29
by family structures that were created
09:31
like surrogate families for slaves that
09:33
were sold so they would have friends on
09:36
other plantations look after slaves that
09:38
were sold culture there's this emergence
09:40
of a new language and music music was
09:44
very influential very important for
09:46
slaves and religion that we would see
09:48
the emergence of new religions that
09:50
combined elements of African religions
09:52
with Christianity these are always the
09:55
African sought to maintain autonomy in
09:58
their situation all right so let's go
10:01
over to some test tips for multiple
10:03
choices short answer definitely know the
10:05
impact of the Elena in the first Great
10:06
Awakening what were the goals of
10:08
mercantilism and colonial economic goals
10:11
how did they differ reads us for the
10:12
growth of slavery and its impact for
10:14
essay questions definitely be familiar
10:17
with the reasons for the growth of
10:18
slavery and its impacts impact is well
10:20
including ways Africans resisted their
10:23
plight over their really tough

00:03
yo what's up a push peeps we have a push
00:07
review this Spanish English French and
00:09
Dutch colonization video for you today
00:12
this one is screaming to me a potential
00:15
essay topic or short answer question
00:18
topic so make sure you are familiar with
00:21
these European powers and their
00:23
colonization of the Americas alright so
00:27
let's start off this is a combination of
00:28
periods 1 & 2 now much of these periods
00:32
focus on European exploration and their
00:35
impact on the Americas and as I just
00:37
mentioned this is a great potential
00:39
short answer slash essay topic ap is
00:43
asked these questions before in the past
00:45
and it's and they could very well ask
00:47
them again on your test in May so some
00:50
big idea questions to think about while
00:52
we're similarities differences among the
00:53
European powers and what impacts it each
00:56
power have on North America and it's
00:58
inhibited to European exploration let's
01:00
talk about reasons for by the way if you
01:02
see words here that are bolded that
01:04
means it is mentioned in the curriculum
01:05
and you best know it so there are things
01:09
like wealth power and status and the
01:11
spread of Christianity or religion think
01:14
of the 3 G's gold glory and God those 3
01:18
G's are reasons why European countries
01:20
were exploring the Americas we have
01:22
technological improvements which allowed
01:24
them to explore things like the sextant
01:26
up here which was like its first which
01:29
was like a GPS for ships which allowed
01:32
them to determine exact location and
01:34
also the caravel a ship like this which
01:37
was developed by the Portuguese which
01:39
traveled much faster interactions when
01:42
natives during this time many or most
01:44
Europeans all natives as uncivilized
01:46
they would use terms like savages and
01:48
barbaric when describing Native
01:50
Americans and there were differences
01:52
over land ownership the idea that Native
01:55
Americans saw land is belonging to a
01:57
group of people or the community whereas
01:59
Europeans saw belonging to individuals
02:01
there's differences in family in
02:03
generals and also religion that led to
02:05
conflicts between European and natives
02:08
so there's this misunderstanding of each
02:10
group
02:10
by the other so it's sort of a Spanish
02:13
colonization everything read that's
02:14
where Spain was Spain became the early
02:18
European leader in exploration and they
02:20
tend to settle in South America and the
02:22
southwestern portion of the United
02:23
States that's why if you travel to Latin
02:25
America they speak Spanish Spain sots
02:29
precious metals things like gold and
02:31
silver and they sought to acquire these
02:33
from mines we have Spanish conquistadors
02:36
people like Hernan Cortes who conquered
02:38
1000 chitlin which was the present-day
02:41
Mexico City in 1519 and he conquered the
02:44
Aztecs due to advanced weapons and
02:47
disease Native Americans were not immune
02:50
to European diseases Francisco Pizarro
02:52
conquered the Incas in Peru and then
02:54
with the emergence of the Columbian
02:55
Exchange which is which is the transfer
02:57
of goods people people's ideas and
03:00
diseases across the Atlantic so what are
03:03
the impacts on the Americas holy cow no
03:05
this the impacts of the Colombia
03:07
exchange on America on the Americas and
03:10
on Europe on the America as we see
03:12
disease decreased native populations
03:14
drastically as maize 90% in some areas
03:17
died and the livestock and guns altered
03:20
hunting and warfare especially for
03:22
Native Americans living on the Great
03:24
Plains the introduction of things like
03:25
horses transformed native life what's
03:28
the impact on Europe well new crops
03:30
things like potatoes and maize increase
03:33
the population of Europe drastically
03:36
this increased wealth led to capitalism
03:39
the emergence of capitalism and the
03:41
decline of feudalism Spanish colonial
03:44
societies we're going to talk about now
03:45
Spain really sought tight control from
03:48
the crown they were very active in the
03:50
colonies and they wanted to convert many
03:52
natives again that idea of God with the
03:55
3gs
03:56
most Spanish settlers were men leading
03:58
to racially mixed populations with
04:00
natives we have the emergence of a caste
04:03
system which included mestizos which
04:06
were people of mixed Spanish and native
04:08
ancestry this is a very key point
04:11
Spanish men tended to intermarry with
04:13
Native Americans we'll see that's not at
04:16
all what happens with the English
04:18
there's a good contrasting point for the
04:21
two European country
04:23
mulattos were also part of the caste
04:26
system these were people that were mixed
04:28
Spanish and African ancestry the in
04:30
comiendo system developed which were
04:33
royal land grants of Spanish settlers
04:35
and the Spanish settlers promised to
04:37
Christianize natives on the land and
04:38
they would gain tribute from the natives
04:40
in other words it was simply slavery for
04:43
Native Americans I have a detailed video
04:46
on the communist system check it out in
04:47
the description below
04:49
eventually the in command system is
04:51
going to be replaced by African slave
04:54
labor there were debates that emerged
04:57
over how natives should be treated we
04:59
see the emergence of two people in
05:00
particular Wanda Sepulveda he argued the
05:03
harsh treatment of natives was justified
05:05
and this guy Bartone de las casas he
05:08
advocated her favored better treatment
05:11
of natives and his writings really
05:13
helped lead to the decline of encomienda
05:15
system he was very critical Spain and
05:17
his writings introduced the idea of the
05:19
black legend this idea that Spain was a
05:22
brutal colonizer that exploited natives
05:25
and he really brought a lot of attention
05:26
to the plight of Native Americans the
05:29
Pueblo Revolt occurred in 1680 in the
05:32
southwestern portion of the United
05:34
States the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico
05:37
they successfully overthrew the Spanish
05:39
for about a dozen years now the Spanish
05:42
do regain control but as a result they
05:44
are much more accommodating of native
05:47
culture they were less restrictive of
05:48
their practices especially religious
05:51
practices alright let's jump on over to
05:53
English colonization first permanent
05:56
settlement was in Jamestown in 1607 and
05:59
here is Jamestown you can go and visit
06:01
it today
06:01
in Virginia set along the Atlantic and
06:04
the present-day US and Caribbean and
06:06
applied many of the same tactics used in
06:08
Ireland towards natives now before the
06:10
English colonized America they took over
06:14
Ireland and they treated the Irish very
06:16
harsh and they basically looked at them
06:18
as a separate group of people they
06:21
basically sought to dominate the Irish
06:23
they the natives were seen as savages
06:26
and they were excluded from English
06:28
settlement so unlike the Spanish or the
06:30
French which we'll see which they have
06:32
you know they're living amongst the
06:33
natives that does not happen with
06:35
English
06:36
again that's another good contrasting
06:39
point England sent large amounts of men
06:41
and women to the colonies unlike the
06:44
French in Spanish which sent relatively
06:46
few numbers of men the English sent a
06:49
lot of people that were both men and
06:50
women they focus on agriculture and they
06:53
had hostile relationships or conflicts
06:55
with the natives there's more info free
06:58
or contrasting paragraph let's talk
07:00
about the different colonies while in
07:02
New England colonies like Massachusetts
07:04
and Rhode Island they were founded
07:05
Massachusetts by Puritans they sought to
07:08
establish a community of like-minded
07:09
believers this dude John Winthrop gave a
07:13
famous speech where he talked about
07:14
Massachusetts being a city upon a hill a
07:17
model Society for all of the world to
07:19
look up to and they really focused in
07:22
New England on agriculture and commerce
07:25
it was a mixed economy those that were
07:28
not like-minded be hit believers were
07:30
outcasts people like Roger Williams and
07:32
Anne Hutchinson which challenged Puritan
07:34
doctrines they were kicked out of the
07:37
colony the middle colonies were going to
07:39
jump on over to colonies like
07:40
Pennsylvania New York they were the most
07:43
diverse religiously ethnically and
07:45
demographically of the English colony so
07:48
you see people that are not just from
07:49
England emigrating to the middle
07:52
colonies but other countries like
07:53
Germany as what is present-day Germany
07:55
as well many immigrants from Europe came
07:58
to these counties they were religiously
08:00
tolerant Pennsylvania was founded by
08:02
this dude William Penn who saw it as a
08:03
holy experiment where it would be
08:05
religiously tolerant II hope to make
08:07
money the southern colonies which
08:10
include the Chesapeake Maryland of
08:12
Virginia North Carolina those three
08:14
focus on tobacco which was a niche and
08:16
they initially used indentured servants
08:18
and later African slavery after Bacon's
08:22
Rebellion witch plantation owners moved
08:25
from a temporary labor supply of
08:27
indentured servants to a permanent one
08:29
of African slaves South Carolina in the
08:31
West Indies they focused on rice and
08:33
sugar cultivation and slaves made up
08:35
most of the population it was very hot
08:38
very humid and very arduous work for
08:41
these slaves then the colonies had some
08:44
form of representative assembly New
08:47
England had the town hall meetings
08:50
Virginia had the Virginia House of
08:52
Burgesses right England promoted this
08:55
idea of mercantilism the idea that the
08:57
counties existed for the benefit of the
08:59
mother country and the purpose was to
09:01
provide raw materials and markets for
09:03
England they focus on controlling a
09:05
balance of trade the more gold and
09:07
silver that flew into the country the
09:10
better and more wealthy that country
09:12
would become the Navigation Acts were
09:15
created that allowed for counties to
09:16
trade only with England so if you're
09:18
living in Massachusetts for example
09:20
you're expected to only trade with
09:23
England and many colonists resisted
09:26
these acts and they smuggle this will be
09:28
a common theme pre 1776 that colonies
09:32
will smuggle to get around these laws
09:33
rights jump on over to French
09:35
colonization we see here the Louisiana
09:37
Purchase and much of Canada is where the
09:40
French were focused so samuel de
09:42
champlain found in Quebec in 1608 one
09:45
year after Jamestown most of the
09:46
colonists were men again unlike the
09:49
English who were men and women like
09:52
Spain France accepted intermarriage
09:54
Maties were children of French and
09:57
native ancestry and they really the
10:00
French really focus on fur trade with
10:01
natives they developed friendly
10:03
relations with natives cordoba were
10:06
these French fur traders they were
10:08
called runners of the woods and knew
10:09
France had a governor-general that that
10:12
ruled it was appointed in Paris so like
10:14
Spain the crown kind of had tight
10:17
control over this there was no
10:19
representative assembly like there was
10:21
in the English colonies so let's talk
10:24
about relations with natives they did
10:26
not take a substantial amount of native
10:27
land like the English did and they did
10:30
not force them into slavery like the
10:32
Spanish so the French really had the
10:33
best relationship with natives out of
10:35
those three Christian Indians were
10:37
allowed to have a lot of autonomy again
10:39
that word autonomy or independence and
10:42
many natives were killed by diseases
10:45
just like they were by the Spanish and
10:47
the English alright we'll finish up a
10:49
Dutch colonization we have Henry Hudson
10:51
of the Dutch East India Company he
10:53
reached New York in 1609 the Dutch
10:55
established trade post in New York and
10:57
present-day Manhattan and Albany and
11:00
like the French the Dutch set few
11:02
Europeans to settle and they formed a
11:04
lion
11:04
says and intermarried with the native so
11:06
three of the four European countries who
11:09
talked about intermarried with the
11:11
natives it's the English that did not
11:13
the Dutch created the idea of the joint
11:15
stock company which is a forerunner to
11:17
the present-day corporation and this is
11:19
where people would pool their money
11:20
together and they would share in the
11:22
profits and losses of voyages again we
11:25
talked about that with Jamestown the
11:27
establishment of Jamestown by the
11:29
English that was created to join stock
11:31
company by the Dutch New Netherland they
11:34
dominated the Atlantic slave trade early
11:37
on and married women retained rights
11:39
when married unlike English women who
11:42
lost their land if you were an English
11:44
woman and you were single and you won't
11:47
land and you got married you would lose
11:48
that land it would go to your husband
11:51
there was some religious toleration
11:53
although it was done privately not
11:55
publicly behind in your home you could
11:58
practice whatever religion you really
11:59
wanted to but you couldn't do it
12:00
publicly all right some test steps for
12:03
multiple choice and short answer reasons
12:04
for European exploration whether it's
12:06
the three GS or technology
12:07
characteristics of European colonies
12:09
know the characteristics of the British
12:11
colonies the New England ones the middle
12:13
and the southern the impacts of contact
12:16
on natives and Europeans the Columbian
12:18
Exchange that is just screaming to me a
12:20
short answer question and four essays
12:22
comparing and contrasting
12:23
characteristics and goals that was a
12:25
summer essay for my students some things
12:28
to keep in mind the British sent a large
12:30
number of men and women I've said this
12:32
so many times I hope you remember this
12:33
they also focus on agriculture and
12:35
they'd hostile relations with natives
12:37
the French said fewer Europeans and they
12:39
focus on trade alliances with natives
12:41
now that oh so important synthesis point
12:44
which could make or break an essay a way
12:47
to achieve this if the essay does not
12:49
tell you to you could divide it up into
12:51
political social and economic categories
12:54
now the easier way I believe is the
12:57
connected to another time period but you
12:59
can't just mention it you have to
13:01
explain it so for example you could say
13:04
you could write something like this the
13:06
arguments used by Europeans to justify
13:08
colonization included spreading
13:10
Christianity this is a similar argument
13:12
that was used by some Americans that
13:14
sought to spread Christianity in Asia in
13:16
the late 1930s
13:18
20 centuries after the u.s. acquired
13:20
land in the spanish-american war so I'm
13:22
not just naming another time period I'm
13:24
not just connecting it I'm explaining
13:26
how it's similar a lot of students have
13:28
no problem connecting the explanation is
13:30
where many students lose points but
13:32
that's not going to be you because you
13:34

00:00
hey what's up a push people today we
00:02
have the Enlightenment for you a topic
00:04
that is specifically mentioned in the
00:06
new curriculum and has an instrumental
00:09
role in the development of the United
00:11
States so definitely be familiar with
00:12
this topic for the new push curriculum
00:15
so let's take a look exactly at the new
00:16
a.push curricula in their way bit key
00:18
concept two point three Roman numeral I
00:20
letter B several factors promoted and
00:23
glekas ation in the British colonies the
00:25
growth of the autonomous political
00:27
communities based on English models the
00:29
development of commercial ties and legal
00:31
structures the emergence of
00:33
transatlantic print culture Protestant
00:35
evangelism religious toleration and the
00:37
spread of European enlightenment I DEA's
00:41
so definitely be familiar with the fact
00:43
that the layman had tremendous had a
00:44
tremendous tremendous impact on American
00:47
and the world politics and society and
00:50
again like everything that you see in
00:52
that curriculum that specifically
00:54
mentioned in the white area make sure
00:55
you are familiar with it that it's fair
00:57
game for the test that you are expected
00:59
to know without a prompt whatsoever
01:01
alright let's go over some background
01:03
info what the heck is the Enlightenment
01:05
well is a movement that believed that
01:07
reason and knowledge could lead to
01:09
progress and advancements in society so
01:12
when exactly did this occur it was in
01:14
the 17th and 18th centuries and it
01:17
originated in Europe so what is the
01:19
impact of it well a helped challenged
01:21
traditional Authority especially
01:23
government and monarchies in this idea
01:26
that maybe monarchies and leaders with
01:28
all this power wasn't the best way for
01:30
government to be run all right some key
01:33
Enlightenment thinkers that you should
01:34
be familiar with the first guy up is
01:36
john locke arguably the most famous one
01:38
he is a reading called the two treatises
01:40
of government and he laid forth this
01:43
belief in natural rights and there are
01:45
three natural rights that all people are
01:47
born with life liberty and property that
01:49
sounds familiar
01:50
because thomas jefferson took that and
01:52
changed property to the pursuit of
01:54
happiness in the Declaration of
01:56
Independence he also believed in this
01:58
idea of the consent of the governed and
02:00
consent means you are giving your
02:02
permission so the permission of those
02:05
that are governed what exactly does that
02:07
mean it means that the government or the
02:09
leaders rule with the people's
02:11
permission in other words
02:13
like them to run the government on their
02:16
behalf and in a very worst-case scenario
02:19
that people can overthrow the government
02:20
if necessary they can certainly at least
02:22
vote them out of office that's what he
02:24
meant by the consent of the governed and
02:25
these ideas were influential in the
02:28
Declaration of Independence next up we
02:31
have Baron de Montesquieu and he wrote
02:33
the spirit of laws and he advocated
02:36
checks and balances and separation of
02:38
powers in other words dividing power
02:40
among branches would help prevent
02:43
government abuse and we see this in our
02:45
government today with three separate
02:47
government branches we have the
02:49
legislative branch which makes laws the
02:51
executive branch which enforces laws and
02:53
the judicial branch which determines
02:55
whether or not these laws are
02:56
constitutional this idea is in part
03:00
thanks to Beryl de Montesquieu Thomas
03:02
Paine or t-pain was a British born
03:05
individual who later moved to the United
03:08
States and he wrote Common Sense and he
03:10
advocated that the u.s. declare
03:13
independence from England he wrote that
03:14
in January 1776 it was one of the
03:17
best-selling pamphlets at that time and
03:21
just like John Locke Thomas Paine helped
03:24
influence the Declaration of
03:25
Independence so let's talk about some
03:27
key ideas that are seen in the US
03:28
government as a result of the
03:31
Enlightenment again as I mentioned
03:32
before we have the three branches of
03:33
government we also have freedom of
03:35
speech which was this idea introduced by
03:36
another Enlightenment thinker Voltaire
03:38
and the ideas which encourage
03:40
individuals to challenge authority in
03:42
unjust government helped inspire the
03:45
American Revolution so again these ideas
03:47
of those Enlightenment thinkers really
03:49
made colonists feel you know why our
03:51
government is not serving us properly we
03:54
should overthrow that government and
03:56
Enlightenment ideas we're seen in other
03:58
revolutions as well not just the
04:00
American Revolution we have the French
04:02
Revolution in 1789 and we have Latin
04:05
American revolutions as well people like
04:07
Simona Bolivar who plays a huge role in
04:09
a lot of Latin American countries
04:12
gaining independence from Spain all
04:15
right some test steps for the
04:16
Enlightenment multiple choice and short
04:17
answer questions they may give you an
04:20
excerpt of a reading maybe it's a job
04:22
lock maybe it's a Montesquieu and just
04:24
know what those impacts are be able to
04:26
explain them
04:27
short answer be able to identify and
04:29
describe enlightenment thinkers and
04:31
their impacts perhaps you'd have to
04:32
choose one or two of them and for essay
04:36
questions think about the causes of the
04:38
American Revolution and how exactly did
04:40
the Enlightenment fit into the causes of
04:42
the American Revolution
04:44
all right that's everything you guys
04:46
need to know about the Enlightenment I
04:48

what's going on a push piece we have a
00:01
good one for you today this one is on
00:03
the Chesapeake colonies part of the
00:05
southern region of the British thirteen
00:08
colonies before I begin it is shout out
00:10
time I want to give a shout outs to mr.
00:12
Roush his class at goshi High School and
00:14
in a push class that is watching in
00:17
Bermuda thank you all so much for your
00:19
support I appreciate best of luck it
00:21
will do awesome on this exam all right
00:25
let's do a brief intro of the Chesapeake
00:27
colonies what are those two colonies
00:29
think about it you know it yeah you're
00:31
right look at you little genius it is
00:33
Maryland and Virginia named because of
00:36
the Chesapeake Bay try speaking economy
00:39
so we see predominantly agriculture and
00:41
lots of rural sediments with plantations
00:44
many of these plantations are gonna go
00:47
grow crash crop cash crops specifically
00:50
tobacco it will make lots and lots of
00:53
money early on in the history we see the
00:55
huge influx of indentured servants who
00:57
are working these are people who had
00:59
their passage paid to the Americas in
01:01
exchange for working usually about four
01:03
to five years but that's gonna
01:05
drastically decline the number of
01:07
indentured servants after 1676 because
01:10
of Bacon's Rebellion in Jamestown a lot
01:13
of poor landless White's rebelled and
01:17
burned down the town so what is the
01:18
impact of that well we'll see a growth
01:20
of slavery and the head right system is
01:23
going to benefit wealthy landowners this
01:26
would provide additional acres of land
01:28
usually about 50 to individuals who paid
01:31
for the passage of an indentured servant
01:33
and again after 1676 we really see a
01:37
decline in indentured servitude and in
01:40
addressing increase in African slave
01:43
labor for demographics again talking
01:45
about the makeup of the counties people
01:47
etc we see some families some extended
01:50
families but many white male indentured
01:53
servants early on we also have a lower
01:55
life expectancy than new england and the
01:57
middle counties it's much warmer their
01:59
diseases are spreading and many people
02:02
died at 20 do you have any idea what
02:03
that means that means I'd be dead for a
02:06
very long time but more importantly it
02:07
means that people were having midlife
02:09
crises at 10 can you believe that that's
02:12
insane
02:13
all right Chesapeake politics usually
02:15
people jump right to the Virginia House
02:17
of Burgesses located in Jamestown and
02:21
also Williamsburg Virginia it was
02:23
actually located both places and they
02:25
switched 1619 the Virginia House of
02:27
Burgesses was established as the first
02:30
representative assembly in the American
02:33
British colonies the governor of
02:36
Virginia was appointed by England and
02:37
worked with the Virginia House of
02:39
Burgesses voting requirements did change
02:42
over time but most consistently it was
02:45
limited to land owning men and later
02:48
housekeepers or heads of household even
02:50
if they didn't necessarily own land if
02:51
they were renters or something instead
02:53
and this really was a small group of
02:56
people one it's men to their white men
02:58
in theory it's really wealthy men as
03:00
well and the elite wealthy planters
03:03
dominated politics and in turn will make
03:06
laws that favor them that's why we'll
03:08
see things like the head right system
03:09
emerge and slave codes as well religion
03:13
in the Chesapeake most people think of
03:15
the Maryland acts of toleration which
03:17
were created in Maryland which was
03:19
founded by Lord Baltimore the second
03:21
here is good old Lord Baltimore this
03:24
granted religious freedom but only to
03:27
Christians this was specifically aimed
03:29
at protecting Catholics Maryland was
03:32
founded as kind of a safe haven for
03:34
Catholics and there was fear that they
03:36
would be outnumbered by Protestants so
03:38
the Maryland of that acts of toleration
03:40
were passed to assure religious
03:43
toleration to all Christians but they
03:45
did not extend that to other religions
03:48
beyond Christianity has tips we'll
03:50
finish up with today for multiple choice
03:52
and short answer be able to compare
03:54
contrast this with other regions and for
03:56
essays same thing
03:58
comparing as well whether it is politics
04:02
or the formation or the impact of
04:04
religion or economics or anything like

00:21
dominican republic so cool that these
00:23
videos are being watched in other
00:24
countries thank you for your support I
00:26
appreciate it all right let's do a brief
00:28
intro the New England colonies consisted
00:31
of Massachusetts Rhode Island
00:32
Connecticut and New Hampshire most
00:35
people when they think of the New
00:36
England colonies think of Massachusetts
00:38
that's your John Winthrop and those
00:40
Puritans alright let's talk about the
00:43
New England economy and it really
00:45
consisted of small towns and family
00:48
farms not plantations like the south the
00:51
geography and the climate did not favor
00:54
large-scale farms and plantations in New
00:57
England like they did in the south we
00:59
also have a mixed economy of Agriculture
01:01
and commerce including merchants ship
01:04
bale building whaling etc so lots of
01:07
different commerce was occurring in New
01:10
England and slavery did exist many
01:13
people think that slavery was confined
01:14
only to the southern colonies that is
01:16
not true it did exist in the New England
01:19
colonies it was just on a smaller scale
01:22
right the New England demographics
01:25
talking about the makeup of the people
01:27
you were more likely to see families
01:28
than other regions living close together
01:31
and grandparents too and here's a
01:33
grandparent with his grandchild and
01:35
there were higher life expectancies than
01:37
other regions that is why you were more
01:40
likely see grandparents in New England
01:42
the weather was cooler so diseases
01:44
didn't spread as easily New England
01:47
politics made people think in the town
01:49
hall meetings where the community would
01:52
gather and pretty much anybody could go
01:54
to the town hall meetings but in order
01:55
to vote in the town hall meetings would
01:57
to be a member of the church would to be
01:59
white and a land owning mail so a
02:01
significantly small portion of the
02:04
population was able to vote most people
02:07
were not able to vote members of the
02:09
community as I mentioned could attend
02:11
but they could not vote in they could
02:12
not speak
02:13
at these meetings so when you watch
02:15
presidential debates or presidential
02:17
elections you hear this town hall
02:18
meeting where people gather and kind of
02:20
ask questions to the candidates that has
02:22
its roots traced all the way back to the
02:24
New England Town Hall meaning this is an
02:27
early form of democracy although again
02:29
it's very limited the amount of people
02:31
that are able to participate in this
02:33
democracy it is an early form of
02:35
democracy in American history so about
02:37
religion in New England
02:39
Massachusetts was dominated by Puritans
02:41
it was really founded by them John
02:43
Winthrop in his famous city upon a hill
02:45
speech if you want a video that breaks
02:48
that down a quick video lesson for
02:50
minutes check it out in the description
02:51
they were not religiously tolerant so if
02:54
you did not follow in adhere to the
02:57
Puritan lifestyle you would encounter
02:59
challenges and difficulties and could
03:00
even be exiled like Roger Williams was
03:03
to Rhode Island which he helped found so
03:06
here is Roger Williams he was kicked out
03:08
for challenging the clergy along with
03:10
Anne Hutchinson and he established Rhode
03:12
Island where we see separation of church
03:14
and state and religious freedom he also
03:17
treated Native Americans pretty well he
03:19
wanted to pay them for the land that
03:21
they lost so Roger Williams and John
03:23
Winthrop they used to be boys they used
03:25
to be pretty close but they butted heads
03:27
John Winthrop who was a many time
03:28
governor said you know what Roger you
03:30
got to get out of here you're
03:31
challenging the Puritan church too much
03:34
all right some test tips for you for
03:36
multiple choices short answer definitely
03:38
know how religion affected the
03:39
development of New England be able to
03:42
compare and contrast this region with
03:44
other regions and for essays
03:46
specifically I could see one on
03:48
comparing with other regions especially
03:51
the influence of religion and the
03:53
economy so thank you guys very much for

watching I appreciate it best of luck on

00:03
hey push people we have another edition
00:06
for you today this one is on meta comms
00:08
or King Philip's War and this is
00:10
specifically mentioned in the revised
00:12
editions this is one of several examples
00:15
of conflicts between Native Americans
00:17
and colonists in period two so make sure
00:20
you are familiar with this video at the
00:22
end we got a practice short answer
00:24
question for you alright so let's take a
00:27
look and see what it says key concept
00:28
two point one Roman numeral three letter
00:30
e British conflicts and American Indians
00:32
over land resources and political
00:34
boundaries led to military confrontation
00:37
such as meta comms war also known as
00:39
King Philip's War and we'll talk about
00:41
why in New England so the causes are
00:44
listed for you there it's pretty much
00:46
over land and resources alright so key
00:49
ideas before the war we have a Native
00:51
American name ssy he was the leader of
00:54
the Wampanoag Indians and he maintained
00:57
peace with the New Englanders and we're
00:59
gonna focus this video focuses on the
01:01
Wampanoag Indians and here is masa SWA
01:05
down here interacting with various
01:09
colonists from New England on a sidenote
01:12
another Native American from this tribe
01:14
was instrumental in teaching New
01:16
Englanders how to farm especially when
01:20
it comes to corn so they had positive
01:22
relations early on with each other and
01:25
we'll see why that kind of falls apart
01:27
now
01:27
masses was son Medicom he was called
01:30
King Philip by the countess that was
01:32
kind of his English name so it is the
01:34
exact same person when you see Medicom
01:36
that is also King Philip don't be
01:39
confused by that police he becomes chief
01:42
in 1662 so like his father he saw to
01:46
continue living in harmony with the
01:48
colonists and getting along with them
01:50
however colonial encroachment everybody
01:53
right now makes sure you know this word
01:55
encroachment my students please circle
01:57
this for me encroachment very important
02:00
word you can use it in short answer
02:01
questions or writing that will really
02:03
strengthen your writing it means to come
02:05
on to somebody's land so the colonists
02:08
are coming on to the land of these
02:10
Native America
02:11
including colonists from Plymouth now
02:14
Metacom in the natives they're not going
02:16
to like this they're gonna want to keep
02:18
some of their autonomy and keep the
02:20
colonists from encroaching on their land
02:22
by the mid 1670s natives were vastly
02:26
outnumbered by the colonists 50,000 to
02:29
20,000 so the war begins in 1675 when
02:33
three Wampanoag Native Americans were
02:36
hanged in Plymouth Metacom he allied
02:38
himself with neighboring tribes and they
02:41
attacked towns in New England and here
02:43
you see an early painting of this war
02:46
initially Metacom in the Native
02:48
Americans were successful and colonists
02:50
were pushed far back towards the east
02:52
coast towards the Atlantic Ocean
02:54
however colonists soon turned the tide
02:59
and they sided with the Iroquois Indians
03:01
who provided vital aid to the colonists
03:04
and eventually defeating the Wampanoag
03:07
Indians and this 8 that their
03:10
acquaintance provided actually developed
03:13
into an alliance in New York and we'll
03:15
talk more about the Iroquois when we get
03:16
to the French and Indian War so what our
03:18
effects of the war wants 1678 the war
03:21
ended Metacom was captured and killed
03:23
and here is a picture you can actually
03:25
go to the site where Medicom was
03:28
captured I would like to go there
03:29
someday and colonists retaliated by
03:32
destroying Native villages so there was
03:35
lots of villages on both sides and
03:39
dwellings that were destroyed and many
03:41
Native men women and children were
03:44
either killed or were sold into slavery
03:46
in the West Indies including Metta coms
03:49
wife and sons so for many Native
03:52
American life drastically changed after
03:55
the war so what's the significance of it
03:57
while the war reinforced the image of
03:59
natives being seen as savages in the
04:01
eyes of many colonists and here is a
04:04
painting of Medicom from the 1700s that
04:09
kind of reinforces this image and Native
04:12
American resistance decrease in New
04:14
England this is very important to know
04:15
this is really one of the last instances
04:18
of major resistance against New
04:22
Englanders by Native Americans
04:24
and countess continued to expand on
04:26
native land after the war so this common
04:29
theme of encroachment on land will
04:30
continue after this war so some test
04:33
steps to finish up for multiple choice
04:35
and short answer definitely know the
04:36
causes and impacts and try to connect
04:38
this result to another time period maybe
04:41
you'll see a question about it
04:42
connecting it to another time period or
04:44
battle for a Native Americans for essay
04:46
questions you'll never see one about
04:48
meta comms war but you will what you
04:50
could likely see one about European
04:52
colonial relations with native so you
04:55
could tie this in for the synthesis
04:57
point you could connect this to another
04:59
time period for example after the Battle
05:02
of Wounded Knee in which the natives
05:03
lost in 1890 there was little resistance
05:06
to the American government afterwards
05:08
and they were no longer significant
05:10
military threat just like the Wampanoag
05:13
Indians were no longer a threat to New
05:17
England colonists alright your short
05:19
answer question meta comms king philip's
05:21
war was when the bloodiest wars between
05:23
Native Americans and New England
05:24
colonists a briefly explained one cause
05:27
of meta comms or King Philip's War be
05:29
briefly explained one short term impact
05:31
of the war see briefly explained one
05:34
long term impact of the war and remember
05:37
you must have two to three sentences per
05:39

05:42
for C check the description for a link

begin to shout out time shout out to mr.
00:22
the whales class and mrs. Morris's dual
00:25
enrollment AP US history class thank you
00:29
guys for watching I really appreciate
00:31
the support if you want a shout out to
00:33
your teacher just leave it in the
00:35
comment section below alright let's take
00:37
a look at three point one it says
00:38
British attempts to assert tighter
00:40
control over its North American colonies
00:43
and the colonial resolve to pursue
00:45
self-government led to a colonial
00:47
independence movement in the
00:49
Revolutionary War so we're really going
00:50
to focus on the causes of the
00:52
Revolutionary War here some big idea
00:54
questions how did this 7 Years War alter
00:57
the relationship between the British and
00:59
colonists and what arguments the
01:01
colonist used to resist Bryn's actions
01:03
after the war let's take a look at Roman
01:07
numeral 1 the competition among the
01:09
British French and American Indians for
01:11
economic and political advantage in
01:13
North America culminated in the Seven
01:15
Years War also known as the French and
01:17
Indian War in which Britain defeated
01:19
France and allied American Indians and
01:22
that's straight from page 36 if you
01:24
don't have this curriculum what are you
01:26
waiting for downloaded check the
01:27
description there is a link there so
01:29
let's talk about what led to the British
01:31
French conflict and what were the
01:33
impacts what without a doubt some causes
01:36
are expansion it's all over land
01:39
remember guys when it comes to colonial
01:41
wars it's going to be over land so the
01:43
British colonists are expanding and they
01:45
begin to go into the interior of North
01:48
America or the Ohio Valley day areas
01:50
like present-day western Pennsylvania
01:53
and Ohio and this will lead to conflicts
01:55
because that's where the French are set
01:57
up the Iroquois Native Americans they
02:00
were one of the few groups that allied
02:02
themselves with the British most other
02:04
Native Americans allied themselves with
02:06
the French and there is the Iroquois the
02:09
flag for the Iroquois Confederacy and as
02:12
a result of this
02:13
which ends in 1763 the British win and
02:16
the French are essentially removed from
02:18
North America and many Native Americans
02:20
as a result lose a valuable trading
02:23
partner a partner that they would trade
02:25
fur with and remember going back to
02:27
previous ideas the French had a really
02:31
good relationships with the native so
02:34
not only did the natives lose a trading
02:35
partner but they lost a very good Ally
02:38
and the British colonists began to
02:40
expand or encroach onto Native American
02:43
land and this will lead to Pontiacs
02:46
rebellion in 1763 which was a reaction
02:49
by Native Americans to resist colonial
02:52
encroachment and also the establishment
02:55
or the creation of the proclamation line
02:57
of 1763 by the British government which
02:59
forbid westward expansion past the
03:02
Appalachian Mountains so were some
03:05
impacts of the war well Britain gained
03:07
massive amounts of land in North America
03:09
again France is basically gone now with
03:12
that comes a cost and financial cost
03:14
that Britain is in debt from the war
03:17
their massive amounts of debt so the way
03:19
to get rid of this debt in Bryn's eyes
03:21
is to begin to tax colonists so they
03:23
sought to raise revenue and gain more
03:26
control over the colonies now this ends
03:29
a time period known as salutary neglect
03:31
in which Britain pretty much left the
03:33
colonies alone as long as they're making
03:35
money and not like roughly too many
03:36
feathers so that really comes to an end
03:38
and brain begins to tax the colonies now
03:43
some examples of taxes some major ones
03:47
with a Sugar Act in 1764 which was a tax
03:50
on sugar and the Stamp Act of 1765 which
03:54
you can see here by this picture was not
03:55
well liked by the colonists the Stamp
03:57
Act was a tax on 50 commonly used goods
04:00
such as newspapers playing cards
04:03
marriage licenses pretty much any legal
04:06
document or any paper with writing on it
04:08
was taxed and the colonists hated this
04:11
they did not like the idea of the
04:12
British taxing them so they formed the
04:14
Stamp Act Congress and eventually had it
04:16
repealed now tensions from the Seven
04:19
Years War this directly helped lead to
04:21
the American Revolution between 1763 and
04:25
1776 you
04:26
this massive shift in the relationship
04:30
between the British and the colonists if
04:32
you're looking for a really cool
04:33
assignment about different events and a
04:36
time line activity check the description
04:38
below to go to my website I have a
04:39
really cool activity it's not just the
04:41
timeline it's a point of view timeline
04:43
that will help you gain a better
04:46
understanding of this time period so
04:50
post Seven Years War Brin sought to
04:52
limit expansion we talked about with the
04:54
proclamation line of 1763 basically said
04:57
to Kahlan so you're not allowed to go
04:58
west of the Appalachian Mountains and
05:00
this was to avoid conflict with Native
05:02
Americans and natives would resist the
05:05
encroachment of the countess as we saw
05:06
in Pontiacs rebellion in 1763 all right
05:10
let's take a look at Roman numeral 2 the
05:13
desire of many colonists to assert
05:14
ideals of self-government in the face of
05:16
renewed British imperial efforts led to
05:19
a colonial independence movement and war
05:21
with Britain this is from page 37
05:24
so what United colonists against the
05:27
British again there's lots of colonial
05:29
unity throughout America the colonial
05:31
American history but this is really the
05:32
first time it's colonial unity against
05:34
the British probably one of the biggest
05:37
ones was the issue of economics and
05:40
there were British taxes without
05:41
colonial representation or consent the
05:45
colonists and mine paying taxes to their
05:48
colonial governments but they did mind
05:50
paying taxes to the British government
05:52
and Parliament created taxes without
05:54
colonial representation and with
05:57
colonists like hey we want some
05:58
representation the British said you are
06:00
you're virtually represented because you
06:03
are a part of the British Empire we have
06:04
your best interests at heart and the
06:06
colonists were not buying it they were
06:08
okay with colonial taxes because they
06:10
could vote for representation but they
06:12
could not vote for representation in the
06:14
British government so the colonists
06:16
successfully boycotted taxes like the
06:18
stand back through the Stamp Act
06:20
Congress in which they boycotted these
06:22
the the Stamp Act and tarred and
06:24
feathered these collectors and also the
06:25
Townsend acts they developed more
06:27
resolve in their case so every time the
06:30
British overturned a tax accountants
06:32
like look we basically have a say in
06:34
what we're doing so any texts we don't
06:37
like we'll just boycott it
06:38
and here is a poster from the British
06:41
side depicting the colonists is treating
06:44
the tax collectors very harshly they're
06:45
tarring and feathering this guy and
06:47
dumping a whole bunch of tea down his
06:48
throat so how the colonists justify
06:51
their resistance while they did so in
06:54
many different ways they argued that
06:57
they should have the same rights as they
06:59
should have rights of British subjects
07:01
as saying people living in Britain and
07:03
they rejected the idea of virtual
07:04
representation and they didn't like they
07:07
didn't believe that our parliament acted
07:09
in the best interest of all British
07:11
subjects and they also drew on the
07:13
rights of individuals again this idea of
07:15
the Enlightenment in this that people
07:17
should have a say in taxation they hated
07:19
the writs of assistance which were
07:21
open-ended search warrants that the
07:22
British used to basically search
07:25
colonial ships and these Admiralty
07:27
courts where there was no trial by jury
07:29
and you were guilty until proven
07:31
innocent they the colonists argued that
07:34
that violated their rights as
07:35
individuals and of course Enlightenment
07:38
ideas things like consent of the
07:40
governed life liberty and property from
07:41
our boy who came up with this John Locke
07:44
you got it there he is in local
07:46
traditions of self-rule because the
07:48
colonists were left alone for so long
07:50
and they were able to elect their own
07:51
colonial representatives they wanted a
07:54
greater say in the British government so
07:56
who were some individuals that were
07:58
heavily involved in the independence
08:00
movement why he had colonial leaders
08:01
like Paul Revere and John Hancock they
08:03
were wealthy merchants that protested
08:05
taxation especially John Hancock you had
08:08
Ben Franklin who argued that America
08:10
contributed significantly to the Seven
08:13
Years War through colonial taxes and Men
08:15
during the war itself and he was an
08:18
instrumental co-writer in the
08:20
Declaration of Independence and during
08:22
the American Revolution he really helped
08:24
gain support of France during that war
08:27
which provided vital aid to the
08:29
Americans we all said grassroots we also
08:32
had a grassroots movement just average
08:35
American colonists like laborers
08:37
artisans and women merci Otis Warren
08:40
she was his influential female writer
08:43
that urged independence now let's jump
08:46
on over to patreon mobilizations were
08:48
were gearing up for war the
08:50
large numbers of men and women that
08:53
contributed to the war effort they did
08:55
so by providing financial and material
08:58
support as well as troops now the
09:01
British were heavy odds on favorites in
09:04
the beginning of the war but ultimately
09:06
as we know they did not win so the
09:08
British had the advantages of loyalist
09:11
opposition pretty much one in five
09:13
people were loyal to the crown they had
09:17
a much bigger military and much more
09:19
money than the Americans did now America
09:22
did have their own advantages they're
09:24
familiar with the land they great
09:26
military leadership under people like
09:28
George Washington they were deeply
09:30
committed to their cause this idea of
09:32
liberty and freedom and they had
09:34
valuable foreign aid most notably the
09:37
French after the Battle of Saratoga in
09:40
which Americans defeat the British and
09:42
France is like holy cow they might
09:43
actually like gain independence let's
09:45
stick it to the British inside with the
09:47
Americans let's go over some test steps
09:49
for multiple choice and short answer
09:50
questions absolutely no the Seven Years
09:53
War and its impact on Native Americans
09:54
and the impact of the Seven Years War
09:57
through the scope of the end of salutary
09:59
neglect and the change in British
10:00
colonial relationships for essay
10:03
questions you could see questions about
10:04
the political social and economic causes
10:07
of the Revolutionary War and how can the
10:09
French and Indian War be seen as a
10:10
turning point in American history that
10:12
pretty much was the question for the May
10:17
2015
10:18
AP exam all right short answer question
10:21
I will leave you with to demonstrate
10:23
your knowledge of key concept three
10:25
point one after 1763 British Britain
10:28
began to consolidate its control the
10:29
British colonies a briefly explained one
10:32
reason for this consolidation be briefly
10:35
explain one British action take it
10:37
between 1763 and 1776 and see briefly
10:40
explain one reaction by the colonists to
10:43
the action described in Part B and as
10:46
always please remember each part a B and
10:49
C must be around two to three census so
10:52
you're looking at six to nine sentences
10:54

00:21
your students requesting a shout out
00:23

videos I hope you find them helpful and
00:35
you're all awesome best of luck this
00:37
year especially in May alright let's
00:40
take a look at key concept 3.38 states
00:42
migration within North America a
00:44
competition over resources boundaries
00:46
and trade intensified conflicts among
00:49
peoples and nations that's from page 41
00:51
of the curriculum framework so some big
00:54
ideas what were achieving of the
00:56
northwest land ordinance we will talk
00:57
about this it's specifically mentioned
00:59
very very important number two how did
01:02
foreign policy debates impact America
01:04
domestically we're going to get into
01:06
foreign policy issues with Britain and
01:08
France in particular and a little bit of
01:11
Spain and finally George Washington's
01:13
farewell address what was the message of
01:15
it and did America heed his message we
01:18
shall find out alright Roman numeral one
01:21
states in the decades after American
01:22
independence interactions among
01:24
different groups resulted in competition
01:26
for resources shifting alliances and
01:28
cultural blending so let's take a look
01:31
at relations with Native Americans post
01:33
Revolutionary War now a lot of this land
01:36
that the United States gained at one
01:38
time belonged to the French and then the
01:40
British and now the Americans and the
01:42
Americans are no longer being held back
01:44
by that proclamation light so they're
01:45
going to start to expand further west
01:48
especially into the Ohio Valley area
01:50
okay so let's jump over the Battle of
01:52
Fallen Timbers this was where Native
01:54
Americans led by little turtle were
01:55
defeated and 630 Americans were killed
01:58
in the battle in and later on that year
02:00
the Indian side the Treaty of Grenville
02:03
in this treaty and in this treaty Native
02:05
American ceded or were forced to give up
02:07
a significant amount of land they were
02:09
allowed to retain some of their land
02:11
however but later on that was in
02:13
approached upon and here is the Treaty
02:15
of Grenville treaty life britain and
02:17
natives relationship contributed to
02:19
tensions with the US and we'll see this
02:22
in the war of 1812 so live Americans
02:24
will be upset with the British because
02:25
the British will be supplying weapons to
02:27
Native Americans and encouraging them to
02:30
attack or have hostile relations with
02:32
the American and this will be one of the
02:34
causes of the war of 1812 so keep that
02:37
in the back of your mind that bring in
02:38
the Native Americans their relationship
02:40
will create tension and hostility by the
02:42
Americans
02:43
alright frontier cultures when we're
02:45
talking about the frontier it's kind of
02:47
that East meets West line or
02:48
civilization meets the wilderness and
02:50
one group that you need to be familiar
02:52
with are the scots-irish an example the
02:54
scots-irish are the Paxton boys now the
02:56
scots-irish they tended to set on the
02:58
frontier the edges of settlement and
03:00
they would settle on land without regard
03:02
for ownership so they didn't weren't
03:03
really concerned who was living there
03:05
whether belong to the government whether
03:06
blended Native Americans whomever they
03:08
just took it now they did this place in
03:11
suppressed Native Americans and the
03:12
Paxton boys the march of the Paxton boys
03:14
is an example this this is in
03:16
Pennsylvania when many scots-irish went
03:18
on and massacred many Native American
03:20
women and children so there would be
03:23
lots of tension with Americans living
03:25
another frontier and Native Americans
03:27
because they want that Native American
03:28
land Shay's rebellion holy cow star
03:31
circle and highlight no this bad boy
03:34
super super important so this is a
03:35
rebellion of farmers this is in the
03:37
waning years of the Articles of
03:39
Confederation or the later decreasing
03:41
years and the these were many farmers
03:44
that demanded an end to foreclosures
03:46
what's a foreclosure that's when a bank
03:48
will take your farm because you can't
03:49
pay for they also wanted an end for
03:51
imprisonment for debt and they wanted
03:53
more paper currency so they went on this
03:56
long rebellion for several months they
03:58
closed courts and eventually was put
04:00
down but it took a long time because
04:02
there was a very weak central government
04:03
under the Articles of Confederation
04:05
absolutely positively know that now both
04:08
of these cultures Illustrated tensions
04:11
between the poor or those living in the
04:13
back country and the wealthier those
04:15
living in the interior a lot of these
04:16
rebellions throw us history that we've
04:18
learned about so far can really be
04:20
summed up as a conflict between the rich
04:23
and the poor okay northwest land
04:25
ordinance star this bad boy - holy cow
04:27
no it involves these states that are
04:29
highlighted in black does several things
04:32
you should know all of them one it
04:34
created a process to admit new states to
04:36
the country so once a population of
04:38
60,000 was reached in that territory for
04:41
example the Ohio territory it could
04:44
apply to become a state it also
04:46
guaranteed freedom of religion and trial
04:48
by jury and this is in 1787 so were
04:51
several years before the Bill of Rights
04:53
so this is pretty monumental for the
04:55
time a portion of land sales went to
04:57
fund education so each Township would be
05:00
divided into a six by six square mile
05:03
Township or 36 square miles the 16th
05:07
square mile that money that was used to
05:10
purchase that 16 square mile that money
05:13
would go towards public education so
05:15
there was a big focus on education in
05:17
the north in the northwest land
05:19
ordinance also slavery was abolished in
05:22
the territory this is the first
05:23
congressional ban
05:24
anywhere in the United States on slavery
05:27
so slavery never existed anywhere in the
05:29
Northwest Territory there's also
05:31
protection of private property this idea
05:34
that individuals cannot have their land
05:36
taken away by the government very
05:38
important absolutely no all five of
05:41
those please so talk about government
05:43
relations with natives in the
05:44
Constitution there was absolutely no
05:45
mention of the treatment or relations
05:48
with natives and they did not have
05:50
representation in government Native
05:52
Americans they were not able to vote and
05:54
they didn't have people in the
05:55
government that were really looking out
05:56
for their best interests and this would
05:58
lead to issues over land and treaties
06:01
that would be violated later on and we
06:03
just talked about the Treaty of
06:04
Granville even some of that land that
06:06
they were allowed to keep they
06:07
eventually lost because of encroachment
06:10
from American let's jump on over to
06:12
Spain in California in the 1760s are
06:14
expanding on their settlements into
06:16
California and they establish missions
06:18
or forts that were created and trade
06:20
expanded as well and many natives a
06:23
continuing theme unfortunately in the
06:24
1700s many of them died from disease and
06:27
others were forced to convert to
06:28
Christianity all right key concept three
06:30
point three Roman numeral to the
06:31
continued presence of European powers in
06:33
North America challenged the United
06:35
States to find ways to safeguard its
06:37
borders maintain neutral trading rights
06:39
and promote its eken
06:41
make interests let's talk about some
06:42
diplomatic initiatives well we have
06:44
Jay's treaty and this is with Great
06:46
Britain in 1795 so what this is is
06:49
really kind of a continuation of what
06:52
the two countries the US and Britain
06:54
agreed at the end of the American
06:55
Revolution
06:56
we had the British were damaging some
06:59
ships and they were impressing American
07:02
soldier American sailors or forcing them
07:04
to join the British Navy and John Jay
07:08
went over there in the US did receive
07:09
compensation for these damaged ships
07:11
Britain also promised to leave forts or
07:15
posts that they were occupying still
07:16
after the Revolutionary War but they did
07:20
not end up leaving Jay's treaty is one
07:22
cause of the development of political
07:24
parties because many Americans were
07:26
upset over Jay's treaty and disliked
07:28
Britain so much Pinkney's treaty also in
07:31
1795 is a treaty with Spain and it all
07:34
goes back to this little city down here
07:36
New Orleans in the Mississippi River so
07:39
the u.s. granted net the u.s. was
07:41
granted navigation rights on the
07:43
Mississippi River they were now allowed
07:45
to go up and down and trade on and most
07:48
importantly they had what's known as the
07:50
right of deposit the ability to store
07:52
goods in New Orleans and selva New
07:55
Orleans was very very very important for
07:57
trade so where were the impacts of the
07:59
war between Britain and France well when
08:01
the French Revolution breaks out those
08:02
two countries start going to war with
08:04
each other and keep in mind that the
08:07
French Revolution as well as other
08:09
revolutions were influenced by the
08:10
American Revolution and Enlightenment
08:11
ideas now the u.s. saw to remain neutral
08:14
in the conflict between these two
08:16
countries France and Britain both sought
08:19
to keep the u.s. from trading with the
08:21
other so Britain would do things like
08:22
confiscate American ships that are on
08:25
the way to France and France would do
08:27
the same thing and again this idea I
08:29
just talked about if kidnapping American
08:30
sailors is known as impressment this is
08:32
something that Britain would do they
08:34
would take the soldiers they aboard the
08:36
ship and say hey guess what you're now
08:37
in the British Navy this is a major
08:39
cause of the war of 1812 and the impacts
08:42
of war between Britain and France is
08:44
another cause of emergence of political
08:46
parties because you have people like
08:49
Jefferson who tended to support the
08:51
French and his followers he's like vive
08:52
la France ho ho ho
08:54
we love them because they just overthrow
08:56
through their monarch like we overthrew
08:59
kg3 not too long before and on the other
09:01
side you have Alexander Hamilton who
09:03
will support the British because he's
09:04
all about trade and Britain is the
09:06
biggest trading partner in the country
09:08
now Washington leaves office his
09:10
farewell address becomes a cornerstone
09:12
of u.s. foreign policy and encouraged
09:14
national unity and he warned against two
09:17
things that you should absolutely no one
09:18
said no political parties their bed stay
09:21
away from them and to stay away from
09:24
permanent foreign alliances as well so
09:27
do not be entangled with foreign
09:30
countries nothing good can come from it
09:32
and clearly the u.s. listened to him on
09:34
number one and listened to my number two
09:37
not at all political parties developed
09:39
almost immediately after he left office
09:41
and although the US did avoid permanent
09:44
alliances for a while eventually the
09:46
u.s. changes its position now for a test
09:48
whether it's multiple choice short
09:50
answer or an essay be able to connect
09:52
this idea of permanent foreign alliances
09:53
to the failed Treaty of Versailles in
09:56
1919 after World War one and then the
09:58
u.s. kind of switching its position and
10:00
joining NATO in joining the United
10:02
Nations after World War two finally
10:05
after World War two Washington's
10:07
farewell address is no longer haunting
10:09
the country in terms of permanent
10:11
Lance's alright some tested for multiple
10:14
choice and short answer again
10:15
Washington's farewell address no it
10:17
northwest land ordinance the
10:18
achievements how could this be seen as
10:20
sectional tension think about what they
10:22
outlawed reasons for the development of
10:24
political parties be able to identify a
10:25
couple them that we talked about in here
10:27
and for essay questions issues that led
10:30
to the creation of political parties be
10:33
able to describe them alright guys thank
10:35
you very much for watching I look
10:36
forward to seeing right back here with
10:37
key concept for point one when we talk
10:39
about this dude John Marshall and his
10:41
impact on America thank you for watching
10:44

00:00
hey what's going on a push peach I got a
00:01
great short video for you today we are
00:03
gonna peep out why 1763 was such an
00:07
important year alright so when you see
00:10
1763 I want you to think a watershed
00:13
year what does watershed mean it means a
00:15
turning point if you want a while some
00:18
aap readers in your short answer long
00:20
essay or DBQ use the word watershed it
00:23
means it is the enormous ly important
00:25
time or event and it is a turning point
00:27
meaning that things drastically changed
00:29
now how are you going to remember this
00:31
I'll give you visually to remember
00:33
watershed I want you to spell the
00:36
watershed out as it is turning because
00:40
it is a turning point so when you see
00:43
the word watershed visualize it spelled
00:45
out in a circle as it is turning around
00:47
a point in the middle here so watershed
00:51
equals turning points so why was six
00:53
1763 a turning point I'm gonna give you
00:55
an acronym to remember and it is PPE EEP
00:59
first P stands for Pontiacs rebellion
01:01
that happened in 1763 also we see the
01:05
end of the Seven Years War the French
01:06
and Indian War that led directly to the
01:09
end of salutary neglect by the British
01:12
so the end of the Seven Years War led to
01:14
the end of salutary neglect the e caused
01:16
the e now the P is going to cause the
01:19
other P in 1763 the proclamation line of
01:23
1763 Pyne amateur bang a lot of the
01:26
fighting took place over here west of
01:28
the Appalachian Mountains so the British
01:29
said you know what we're going to avoid
01:30
conflict with the natives by passing the
01:32
proclamation line of 1763 which forbid
01:35
expansion beyond the Appalachian
01:38
Mountains now pass AP exam they asked a
01:40
lot about this information so make sure
01:42
you remember 1763 is all about peep I
01:46
will leave you with this this is a six
01:48
not a nine it's upside down 1763 turning
01:51
around in a circle around a point peep
01:53
turning around a circle right at a point
01:55
because it is a watershed year thanks

00:00
hey what's going on ap people we have a
00:03
push review Thomas Paine's Common Sense
00:05
for you on the docket today this is
00:08
something that specifically mentioned in
00:09
the new aid push curriculum though you
00:11
should definitely be familiar with so
00:13
let's get going and covering common
00:15
sense so let's look at the a push
00:17
curriculum key concept 3.2 Roman numeral
00:20
one letter B States the following the
00:22
colonists belief in the superiority of
00:24
Republican self-government based on the
00:27
natural rights of the people found it's
00:29
clearest American expression and Thomas
00:32
Paine's Common Sense and in the
00:35
Declaration of Independence and this is
00:37
located in page 34 of the curriculum
00:40
flame framework which you can download
00:41
in the description below definitely be
00:43
familiar with those guys and common
00:45
sense played an intricate role in
00:47
influencing the colonists decision to
00:49
declare independence and as I mentioned
00:52
earlier since it is specifically
00:54
mentioned in the new curriculum you
00:55
should be very familiar with it let's do
00:57
a little background I common sense but
00:59
before we get to it let's review some
01:02
events that happen prior to its
01:04
publication in January of 1776 well
01:07
let's go back here to 1775 we have in
01:11
April of that year the battles of
01:12
Lexington and Concord between the
01:14
colonists and the British and these are
01:16
known as the first battles in the
01:18
Revolutionary War even though they had
01:20
been before the Declaration of
01:21
Independence these are nicknamed a shot
01:23
heard round the world in July of that
01:25
year the Continental Congress issues the
01:29
Olive Branch petition which is the
01:32
colonists hope to have peace and have
01:35
their grievances addressed by Britain
01:38
and King George the 3rd and King George
01:39
the 3rd rejects the Olive Branch
01:41
petition if you see an olive branch
01:43
that's a kind of an international symbol
01:45
for peace throughout 1775 in the early
01:47
part of 1776 most colonists did not want
01:50
independence that's very important to
01:52
know guess it's not until later of 1776
01:55
and rather they were seeking a redress
01:57
of their grievances basically hate
01:59
England fix our complaints and go back
02:02
to the days of salutary neglect all
02:04
right so we're going to answer time as
02:06
paint or t-pain who was he well here's a
02:08
picture of him he was a philosopher
02:10
philosopher from England that moved to
02:12
America in
02:14
1974 and he his ideas reflected the
02:17
ideas of that time period known as the
02:20
Enlightenment I do have a video on the
02:21
alignment in the description as well
02:23
that's another thing that specifically
02:24
mentioned the new curriculum so why did
02:28
he publish common sense well he urged
02:30
America and colonists to break away from
02:33
Britain and King George the 3rd and
02:36
here's a statue of Thomas Paine that I
02:38
absolutely love look this guy's like
02:40
stomping on the ground cheering and
02:42
screaming break away from the British
02:46
alright so let's talk about the message
02:48
of common sense and the impact of it
02:50
well the book was divided into four
02:52
sections the first one is the origins of
02:55
government and remarks on English
02:57
Constitution so basically like what his
02:59
thoughts are on government to the
03:02
monarchy and hereditary succession this
03:05
idea that Kings are only Kings because
03:07
well if they're born into the right
03:09
family 3 the present state of American
03:12
affairs and this is where he talked
03:13
about all the issues that are going on
03:15
in America and for the present ability
03:18
of America in this idea that America
03:20
really has come into its own and can
03:22
break away and the important thing to
03:25
note about who it was written for the
03:27
audience of this and this is something
03:29
that the new curriculum you're supposed
03:31
to be able to identify the audience of
03:33
writings the audience was the common
03:36
people and he wanted his average
03:38
everyday Americans you know it was said
03:40
in 1776 that 1/3 of Americans wanted
03:43
independence 1/3 did not want
03:46
independence and 1/3 were on the fence
03:47
and he kind of wrote that to the people
03:49
on the fence to urge them to break away
03:51
he said it was common sense to break
03:53
away and proportionally to the
03:56
population at that time in 1776 that is
03:59
the best-selling book in American
04:01
history as many as 500,000 copies were
04:05
distributed to a population of two and a
04:08
half million so one out of five people
04:10
in America read his book he was
04:13
channeling his inner Oprah during this
04:15
time he's like you get a common sense
04:16
you get a common sense you get a common
04:19
sense and you get one and you get one
04:21
and finally you get a common sense as
04:23
well all right so let's go over some
04:25
test tips for you with
04:27
commonsense multiple choice and short
04:29
answer questions if you see anything in
04:31
those perhaps you would have an excerpt
04:33
from the reading from common sense and
04:35
you would have to be able to identify
04:36
what the purpose is for a short answer
04:38
you get kind of it would give you three
04:41
topics as I explained how those
04:42
contributed to the American Revolution
04:43
and common sense could be one of those
04:45
for an essay question the chances have
04:47
you seen one solely a common sense is
04:49
pretty much zero but it could be part of
04:51
the influences or the causes of the
04:54
American Revolution which is why your
04:55
essay could be about alright hopefully I
04:58
was able to clarify t-pain's common
05:00
sense for you guys today if you have a
05:02
questions or comments feel free to leave
05:03
them in the comment section below if you
05:06

        captions = """
00:03
hey what's going on any push people we
00:06
have a push review George Washington's
00:08
neutrality Proclamation and his farewell
00:11
address such important topics in US
00:14
history especially when we're time up
00:16
foreign policy alright before we begin
00:18
shout out time I have to give a shout
00:19
out to mr. Rhoda Meyers class in Iowa
00:22
you all Rock thank you so much for your
00:24
support of Henry Clay and my videos it
00:27
means the world to me all right so let's
00:29
talk about the neutrality Proclamation
00:31
some background info during the French
00:33
Revolution in the 1790s there was
00:35
conflict that emerged between France and
00:38
Great Britain now there's lots of debate
00:41
in the United States should the United
00:43
States side with the French or should
00:44
they stay out of it so Washington's
00:46
going to issue the following
00:47
proclamation in 1793 he says the duty
00:51
and interest of the United States
00:53
require that they should adopt a conduct
00:55
friendly and impartial or staying out of
00:57
it toward the warring powers I have
01:00
thought fit to declare the position of
01:02
the United States to observe it conduct
01:03
towards these powers respectfully and
01:05
one our citizens to avoid all acts which
01:08
may in any manner tend to go against
01:11
this position and you're looking at this
01:13
picture you know that this is
01:15
Christopher Jackson from Hamilton the
01:17
musical if you have not listened to it I
01:20
will tell you some songs that you must
01:21
that will greatly help you out in a push
01:23
so this highlighted the disputes between
01:26
Jefferson or the Democratic Republicans
01:28
and Hamilton the Federalists Jefferson
01:30
was a supporter of the French and he
01:33
felt the United States should side with
01:34
them Hamilton believed the US should
01:37
stay out of it and a great summary of
01:39
this could be found on the Hamilton
01:40
musicals kept soundtrack cabinet battle
01:43
number two listen to it and this will
01:46
make sense forever for you alright so
01:48
watch it it's very well dressed jumping
01:50
over to this is specifically mentioned
01:51
in the new a push curriculum and this
01:55
topic is great for multiple choice and
01:57
short answer questions and some Big Idea
01:59
questions how to wash you to view
02:01
political parties and how did his ideas
02:03
help influence foreign policy for
02:05
decades to come
02:06
all right some historical background
02:07
this was issued in 1796 Washington left
02:10
office and this was written by why
02:13
and his boy his close friend Alexander
02:16
Hamilton this helped influence US
02:18
foreign policy for years to come
02:21
so almost any foreign policy si this
02:23
could be a synthesis point for you so
02:27
some key parts of the address while he
02:29
warned of foreign entanglements and part
02:31
of this said the great will of conduct
02:33
for us in regard to foreign nations is
02:35
in extending our commercial relations to
02:38
have with them as little political
02:40
connection as possible so far as we have
02:42
already formed in engagements let them
02:45
be fulfilled with perfect good-faith
02:46
Europe has a set of primary interests
02:49
for which to us have none or ver or a
02:53
very remote relation so Washington's
02:56
basically a like look trade is good but
02:59
Alliance is not so good it is our true
03:01
policy to steer clear permanent
03:03
alliances with any portion of the
03:04
foreign world so far I mean as we are
03:07
now what Liberty to do it for let me not
03:09
be understood as capable of patronizing
03:11
in fidelity to existing engagement so
03:14
he's basically saying I don't want to I
03:15
don't want to knock on these current
03:17
engagements I hold the maxim no less
03:19
applicable to public than to private
03:22
affairs that honesty is always the best
03:24
policy I repeat it therefore let these
03:27
engagements because they're observed in
03:29
their genuine sense but in my opinion it
03:31
is unnecessary and would be unwise to
03:34
extend them so stay out of European
03:36
affairs so his ghost this message will
03:40
hover over foreign policy debates for
03:42
decades to come especially when it comes
03:44
a world war one after it there's huge
03:47
debates about whether or not the United
03:48
States should join the League of Nations
03:49
that's because of Washington's address
03:52
so this is a continuity really until
03:54
after World War two that the US will
03:56
stay out of European foreign affairs he
03:59
also warned a political parties and he
04:01
said the alternate domination of one
04:03
faction or party over another sharpened
04:05
by the spirit of revenge natural to
04:07
party dissension which in different ages
04:10
and countries has perpetrated the most
04:12
horrid enormities is itself a frightful
04:15
despot despotism the disorders and
04:18
miseries which results gradually incline
04:20
the minds of men to seek security and
04:23
response and absolute power of an
04:24
individual and sooner or later the
04:27
chief of some prevailing faction more
04:28
able or more fortunate than his
04:31
competitors turns us disposition to the
04:33
purpose of his own elevation on the
04:36
ruins of public Liberty that's a fancy
04:38
way of saying political parties are bad
04:41
and this is not followed by the country
04:44
and check out more in his farewell
04:46
address from the Hamilton soundtrack
04:48
that song one last time it's Washington
04:50
and Hamilton talking about what will be
04:52
in his message and how he's stepping
04:54
down after two turn and for not
04:56
listening Washington basically is ok
04:58
guys thanks for listening and Jefferson
05:00
is like sorry bro because they pretty
05:02
much ignored this part of his farewell
05:04
address all rights finish up with some
05:06
tests tips for multiple choice and short
05:08
answer you can see an excerpt about the
05:11
farewell dress with a neutrality
05:13
Proclamation or your reaction to it and
05:14
think about who would agree who would
05:15
disagree impacts of the proclamation or
05:18

00:00
hey what's going on a push peeps I got
00:01
another good one for you today this is
00:03
on the first party system a great
00:07
potential short answer question or as a
00:09
topic guess what if you're one of my
00:11
students listening to this you're doing
00:13
an essay on it surprise okay let's get
00:16
going so the new curriculum states this
00:18
about the first party system flipped a
00:20
key cuz of 3.2 Roman numeral three
00:22
letter B and it says political leaders
00:25
in the 1790s took a variety of positions
00:27
on issues such as the relationship
00:29
between the national government and the
00:30
state's economic policy foreign policy
00:33
and the balance between liberty and
00:35
order this led to the formation of
00:38
political parties most significantly the
00:40
Federalists led by Alexander Hamilton
00:42
and the Democratic Republican Party led
00:45
by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison so
00:48
it's gonna be Hamilton versus these two
00:51
dudes they do not get along well with
00:53
each other actually Jefferson and
00:55
Madison do but they do not get along
00:57
well with Hamilton alright so why did
01:00
they develop well there's four main
01:02
reasons number one over the power of the
01:05
federal government how strong should it
01:06
be to foreign policy and this really all
01:10
stems from the French Revolution
01:12
illustrated here with the storming of
01:14
the Bastille on July 14 1789 economic
01:18
policy stemming from Hamilton's
01:20
financial plan and finally the balance
01:22
between liberty and order and this stems
01:24
from the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798
01:27
under President John Adams
01:30
administration so let's discuss the
01:32
power of the federal government so
01:35
Federalists favored a strong a stronger
01:38
national or federal or central those are
01:40
interchangeable words government and
01:42
here is Alexander Hamilton played by
01:45
lin-manuel Miranda at the Treasury
01:47
Department in Washington DC I'm gonna be
01:50
referencing Hamilton the musical a lot
01:52
in this video
01:53
Democrat Republicans favored a smaller
01:55
federal government so they were more
01:57
weary of the central government being
02:00
too powerful Madison and this dude
02:04
Jefferson argued that states should be
02:06
able to nullify federal laws and we see
02:08
this with the Virginia and the Kentucky
02:10
resolutions which we'll talk more about
02:12
in a few
02:13
moment so the democratic-republicans
02:16
believe that states state government
02:17
should have a lot of power that they
02:19
should even be able to go so far as to
02:21
nullify federal laws and here is daveed
02:25
Diggs who plays Thomas Jefferson in the
02:28
musical
02:29
all right foreign policy Democratic
02:31
Republicans tended to support France and
02:34
there's a couple reasons why number one
02:36
France provided aid during the
02:37
Revolutionary War come on what's that
02:39
battle after what battle it's
02:40
illustrated here yeah you know you will
02:43
genius it is the Battle of Saratoga
02:45
great job also the Declaration of
02:48
Independence inspired the French
02:50
Revolution and guess who gets credit for
02:51
writing the Declaration of Independence
02:52
you know at Thomas Jefferson so he is so
02:55
honored that his ideas helped inspire
02:57
revolutions throughout the world
02:59
Federalists want to have a beneficial
03:01
relationship with England they saw
03:03
England as a major trading partner and
03:05
this is exhibited through Jay's treaty
03:07
which was negotiated by Chief Justice
03:09
John Jay the first Chief Justice of the
03:12
Supreme Court and this made Britain a
03:15
favourable trading partner even
03:18
preferential treatment when it comes to
03:20
trade and this really upset the French
03:21
and when France and England went to war
03:24
in the 1790s democratic Republicans
03:26
wanted to support France and the
03:28
Federalists wanted to remain neutral and
03:30
Washington is going to side with the
03:33
Federalists and remain neutral when he
03:36
issues his neutrality proclamation I got
03:38
a video on that if you need more info on
03:40
it
03:40
okay economic policy this is really the
03:42
first major difference between Jefferson
03:44
and Hamilton Hamilton's financial plan
03:47
pitted Hamilton against Jefferson and
03:51
Madison the bank of the US or the bus as
03:53
I call it was the most controversial
03:55
aspect this really made Jefferson and
03:59
his followers upset Jeff says followers
04:02
took a strict interpretation versus a
04:05
loose interpretation by the Federalists
04:07
when it comes to reading the
04:09
Constitution and Hamilton said listen
04:11
the Constitution doesn't say we cannot
04:13
have a bank therefore we can that's a
04:16
loose interpretation whereas the
04:18
Democratic Republic had said no I don't
04:20
think so buddy the Constitution doesn't
04:21
say you can therefore you can't and
04:24
ultimately Washington played here by
04:26
Christopher Jackson supports the bus and
04:29
sides with the Federalist of Washington
04:32
is often going to side with Hamilton
04:34
when their debates between Hamilton and
04:37
Jefferson in his first administration
04:39
let's jump on over to balance between
04:41
liberty and order the Alien and Sedition
04:43
Act 1798 under President John Adams
04:46
these are passed to silence his
04:49
Democratic Republican opponents know
04:52
this is very interesting the runner-up
04:53
in the presidential election back then
04:55
became the vice president so we have
04:58
Thomas Jefferson as John Adams vice
05:01
president even though he is a member of
05:03
a different political party so lots of
05:05
tension between the two so they only in
05:08
Sedition Acts are past men and they are
05:11
meant to punish Democratic Republicans
05:14
and punishments for criticizing the
05:16
government included fines and/or jail
05:19
time so if you were a newspaper editor
05:21
and critical of John Adams you could be
05:23
thrown in jail for and Jefferson again
05:26
who is Adams VP and Madison they respond
05:29
with the Virginia and Kentucky
05:30
resolutions and Jefferson's basically
05:32
like dude you're not going to silence me
05:34
I have an idea and this idea is that
05:36
states should be able to nullify the
05:38
Alien and Sedition Acts so they are
05:42
trying to overturn or void these federal
05:46
laws all right so if you want more info
05:50
on any of on these topics I encourage
05:53

throw it in the comments and I will get
00:36
to it eventually
00:37
I promise all right let's take a look at
00:39
key concept 4.1 it states the United
00:42
States began to develop a modern
00:43
democracy and celebrate a new national
00:45
culture well Americans saw to define the
00:47
nation's democratic ideals and change
00:50
their society and institutions to match
00:52
them some so some big idea questions you
00:54
should be thinking about what were the
00:56
reasons for the development of political
00:57
parties definitely know this this to me
01:00
screams a short answer question if I'm
01:02
they pee people and I'm not but if I'm
01:05
writing a short answer question for your
01:06
test I'm going right to this the
01:08
development of political parties and
01:10
characteristics for each party how did
01:12
the Second Great Awakening impact
01:14
America yep that's right I said second
01:16
so we're going back to another Great
01:17
Awakening how did slaves adapt to their
01:19
circumstances and create a new culture
01:22
right he cuts a four point one Roman
01:24
numeral one says the nation's transition
01:26
to a more participatory democracy was
01:28
achieved by expanding suffrage from a
01:30
system based on property ownership to
01:33
one based on voting by all adult white
01:35
men and it was accompanied by the growth
01:37
of political parties so let's take a
01:39
look at the first political parties that
01:40
emerge now remember what a Washington
01:43
say about political parties he was like
01:45
nah man don't form them and as soon as
01:47
he said that they formed so Federalist
01:50
this is the first party system
01:51
Federalists they tended to favor a
01:53
strong central government hence the word
01:55
Federalists they said they were
01:56
supported by the upper-class merchants
01:58
and bankers as well and then were
02:00
pro-british this was because of trade
02:03
with Britain since a lot of them were
02:04
merchants and they focused on improving
02:06
the economy they were pro-british for
02:08
trading and they also favored a loose
02:10
interpretation of the Constitution
02:13
he'll Hamilton justified the Bank of the
02:15
United States he said look just because
02:16
it's not in there doesn't mean it can't
02:18
be done on the other end we the
02:20
democratic-republicans also known as the
02:21
Jeffersonians they were more states
02:24
rights oriented they were supported by
02:25
lower middle classes especially farmers
02:28
farmers were big fans of the
02:29
Jeffersonians they were pro French when
02:32
it came to foreign affairs because of
02:33
Frances help during the American
02:36
Revolution and also because of the
02:37
French Revolution look to the American
02:40
Declaration of Independence and they
02:42
also favored a strict interpretation of
02:44
the Constitution so unless the
02:46
Constitution said you can't do something
02:47
you can't they would argue now both
02:50
parties developed out of two reasons
02:52
they came about because of two reasons
02:53
this could be a short answer make sure
02:55
you can explain why they developed
02:57
Hamilton's financial plan and the French
03:00
Revolution will the Supreme Court
03:01
strengthen the power of the federal
03:03
government during this time and it was
03:05
often done at the expense of state
03:07
government so a couple core cases you
03:09
should be familiar with
03:10
we have Marbury vs. Madison from 1803
03:12
this established the principle of
03:14
judicial review the ability of the
03:16
Supreme Court on the national level to
03:18
declare laws unconstitutional and this
03:21
will be extended to state laws any later
03:24
court case
03:24
Fletcher versus Peck and McCulloch V
03:27
Maryland this upheld the
03:28
constitutionality of the second bank of
03:30
the United States and this gave the
03:32
federal government more power over
03:33
States States could not tax a federal
03:36
agency that they did not like and the
03:40
third Corps case you should know is
03:41
Gibbons versus Ogden this dealt with
03:43
boats on the Hudson River and what the
03:45
Supreme Court said is that Congress not
03:47
States can control interstate commerce
03:50
interstate means two or more I have an
03:54
article on my web page a link to in the
03:56
description and why we know that Chris
03:58
Brown and pitbull did not take AP US
04:00
history
04:01
check it out it relates to this case
04:03
because jump on over to Democrats and
04:05
Whigs they really develop in the 1820s
04:07
and 1830s the Democrats were led by
04:09
Andrew Jackson he was seen as the common
04:11
man and kind of continuing with the
04:13
Jeffersonians they were against the boss
04:15
and Henry Clay's American system I have
04:18
a just a video for the American system
04:20
in the description check it out I got a
04:21
bunch of videos that relates to this his
04:24
American system focused on the Bank of
04:25
the United States
04:26
internal improvements and tariffs no on
04:29
the other end we had the Whigs led by my
04:31
boy Henry Clay there's a young Henry
04:33
Clay
04:33
they developed because they were anti
04:35
Andrew Jackson they favored a stronger
04:38
federal government internal improvements
04:40
tariffs and the boss or the Bank of the
04:42
United States so this is really kind of
04:44
almost a continuation least of the ideas
04:46
of the Federalist Party now regional
04:49
political and economic loyalties
04:51
overshadowed national concerns what does
04:53
that mean well people tended to be more
04:56
loyal to the region than they were the
04:58
nation and we see this in the
05:00
nullification crisis of the 1830s where
05:02
South Carolina led by Dracula I mean
05:05
John C Calhoun really he and other
05:08
states opposed the tariffs of 1828 and
05:11
1832 which were really high and in South
05:13
Carolina takes it a step further and
05:15
even nullified those tariffs and they
05:19
told Andrew Jackson its president hey
05:20
you try to collect these terrorists by
05:22
force or collect them in all we will
05:24
secede so really the country is on the
05:26
break of the Civil War during the
05:28
nullification crisis and during the same
05:30
time we have Webster's Daniel Webster
05:32
his second reply to him this was in the
05:34
Senate this really demonstrated that
05:36
Webster wanted to promote nationalism
05:38
over sectionalism so we see the
05:40
emergence of some leaders like a Henry
05:42
Clay like a Daniel Webster who are
05:44
saying hey America is more important
05:46
than your region I have videos for these
05:49
as well in the description okay four
05:51
point one Roman numeral two while
05:52
Americans embraced a new national
05:54
culture various groups developed
05:55
distinctive cultures of their own we're
05:58
gonna focus on the Second Great
06:00
Awakening they this time period saw to
06:02
inspire humans to achieve perfection so
06:05
we have this dude Charles G Finney
06:07
Charles Grant and Symphony he gave these
06:09
massive sermons to convert individuals
06:12
so he's really bringing people back to
06:15
religion and he's going to be very
06:17
influential in New York especially along
06:20
towns along in towns along the Erie
06:22
Canal utopian societies begin to develop
06:25
and these are social experiments I hope
06:27
to achieve perfection in communities we
06:29
have communities like Oneida Brook Farm
06:31
etc in which these these people really
06:34
live together and they're pretty
06:35
self-sufficient and they're trying to
06:37
achieve perfection in these
06:39
communities now the big thing to know
06:41
about the Second Great Awakening is it
06:43
inspires other reform movements things
06:46
like temperance and abolition and
06:48
education and we'll talk about more of
06:49
those in just a couple minutes now let's
06:51
jump over to the emergence of a new
06:52
national culture well this was a
06:55
combination of European and local
06:57
culture in American culture as well
06:58
there's new American art literature and
07:01
architectural ideas that emerged we see
07:03
John James Audubon who was this great
07:07
outdoorsman and made significant
07:08
contributions this study of birds prints
07:11
of birds he was discovered species left
07:13
and right and really his books became
07:15
very very popular and the Hudson River
07:17
school they focused on landscape
07:19
paintings and they believed nature was a
07:21
great source of wisdom and inspiration
07:23
so if you ever see a painting here's an
07:25
example the Hudson River School painting
07:28
if you ever see a painting of outdoors
07:29
or anything with environment chances are
07:31
it's going to be the Hudson River school
07:33
I always think River outdoors Hudson
07:35
River school
07:36
there you go literature art philosophy
07:38
and architecture reflected a belief in
07:40
human perfectibility and we see this
07:43
evident the transcendentalism movement
07:45
of the 1830s this really encouraging
07:47
individuals to have communication with
07:49
both God and nature now two famous
07:51
writers you should be familiar with is
07:53
one is Ralph Waldo Emerson he wrote
07:55
self-reliance and he believed that
07:58
individuals should follow their own
07:59
self-interest and the other dude is
08:01
Henry David Thoreau and he wrote two
08:04
influential books Walden and civil
08:06
disobedience now in Walden he wrote
08:08
about his experiences of living in
08:09
nature foodtube for two years at Walden
08:11
Pond in civil disobedience we know will
08:13
go on to influence people like Gandhi
08:15
and Martin Luther King during the civil
08:17
rights movement in 1850s and 1960s now
08:21
enslaved African Americans created
08:22
communities and they sought to protect
08:24
their family structures and dignity and
08:25
they did so by developing surrogate
08:27
families or kind of adopted families
08:29
when they were split up through the
08:31
slave trade when families were separated
08:33
others would look after family members
08:36
so they're really these elaborate system
08:37
set up to help deal with the horrific
08:40
loss of family members due to the slave
08:43
trade and slave was also developed and
08:45
this was you to help pass the time while
08:47
working and this played an instrumental
08:50
part of religious services that slaves
08:52
were part
08:53
as well alright four point one Roman
08:56
numeral three increasing number of
08:58
Americans numbers of Americans many
09:00
inspired by new religious and
09:01
intellectual movements worked primarily
09:03
outside of government institutions to
09:05
advance their ideals so what were some
09:07
organizations that attempted to approve
09:09
society and individual behavior while
09:11
the American Temperance Society which I
09:13
mentioned briefly earlier this was
09:15
co-founded by this dude Lyman Beecher
09:16
who happened to be the father of Harriet
09:18
Beecher Stowe
09:19
what did Harriet Beecher Stowe write you
09:21
know this come on very influential book
09:22
that's right Uncle Tom's Cabin by the
09:25
way she was from Cincinnati and this
09:28
really created thousands of chapters
09:30
throughout the United States the
09:31
American Temperance Society and you had
09:33
thousands and thousands of people who
09:35
committed to the temperance movement to
09:37
try to eliminate alcohol and this was
09:40
very closely aligned with the
09:41
abolitionist movement as well
09:43
now Dorothea Dix here is Dorothea she
09:45
saw to improve treatment for the
09:47
mentally ill and really made a big
09:49
difference in the treatment for this
09:50
group of people you have horse man here
09:53
is he's known as the father of education
09:55
I don't know about you he looks like a
09:56
teacher to me and we had shakers as well
09:58
this religious group that practiced
10:00
celibacy and they believed in sexual
10:02
equality so they were really advanced
10:04
for their time when it came to gender
10:06
equality for men and women abolitionists
10:08
and anti-slavery movements we'll talk
10:10
about now they achieved much of their
10:13
success in the north and many northern
10:14
states gradually emancipated their
10:16
slaves and by the early to mid 1800s
10:19
slavery was essentially non-existent in
10:22
the north and there was a create an
10:23
increasing number of free
10:25
african-americans in the north and in
10:27
the south as well and eventually many
10:29
states in the south made it illegal for
10:31
slave owners to manumit or free their
10:34
slaves we see it in places like Virginia
10:36
in particular after 1831 now
10:40
anti-slavery in the South was not very
10:42
successful in changing the status of
10:45
many slaves initially we seen the House
10:48
of Representatives on national level the
10:50
gag order which was instituted by the
10:52
south has prohibited the introduction of
10:54
abolitionist bills in the House of
10:56
Representatives so if a northerner who
10:58
is in the House wanted to ban slavery
11:00
and introduce a bill that would not even
11:02
be allowed to be discussed in the House
11:04
of Representatives this is eventually a
11:06
returned by a very prominent House of
11:09
Representative member John Quincy Adams
11:12
unsuccessful rebellions in the south
11:15
knowing the South many slaves tried to
11:17
change their status by rebellion by
11:19
rebelling but unfortunately for them
11:21
they're very unsuccessful Denmark Vesey
11:23
and 80/20 plan the largest ever slave
11:26
rebellion this never materialized he and
11:28
his followers were hanged and this led
11:30
to more strict slave laws in 1831 we
11:33
have NAT Turner's rebellion which was a
11:35
rebellion of Virginia freed that freed
11:38
many slaves and killed whites on
11:39
plantations and hundreds of blacks were
11:41
killed in retaliation not only those
11:43
that were involved in the rebellion but
11:45
just random blacks as well and again
11:49
just like Denmark the Denmark Vesey
11:52
planned rebellion slave laws become
11:55
stricter every time there's a slave
11:56
rebellion there will be harsher slave
11:57
laws now in 1831 NAT Turner's rebellion
12:00
coincided at the same time with the
12:03
publication of William Lloyd Garrison's
12:05
weekly newspaper The Liberator and here
12:07
is garrison and this call for the media
12:10
and uncompensated and to slavery so he
12:13
was an outspoken critic of slavery one
12:15
of the harshest ones at the time the
12:17
women's rights movement often was
12:18
connected to the abolitionist movement
12:20
and they hope to achieve greater
12:21
equality and you could see this at the
12:24
Seneca Falls convention in New York in
12:25
1848 this was a women's rights
12:27
convention in which people like
12:28
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott
12:31
joined together to propose more rights
12:34
for women it was even attended and
12:35
supported by very well known men such as
12:37
frederick douglass the former slave who
12:40
was a great orator and outspoken
12:42
advocate for women's rights okay let's
12:46
go over some test tips for multiple
12:47
choice and short answer be able to
12:49
identify and explain some court cases
12:51
that increase the power of the federal
12:52
government characteristics of political
12:55
parties in organizations and individuals
12:57
that sought to improve society as well
13:00
as ways as slaves resisted their
13:02
conditions for essay questions be able
13:04
to describe issues that led to the
13:07
creation of political parties and the
13:08
impact of the Second Great Awakening on

for the revised 2015 edition the most
00:12
up-to-date video you will find on key

00:27
and best of luck to you this year
00:30
alright let's take a look at key cuts in
00:32
4.2 it states innovations in technology
00:34
agriculture and commerce powerfully
00:36
accelerated the American economy
00:39
precipitating profound changes to US
00:41
society into national and regional
00:44
identities that is from page 47 of the
00:47
curriculum framework couple of big idea
00:49
questions to think about as we watch
00:52
this video 1 how did the market
00:54
revolution revolutionize the production
00:56
of goods and transform or change gender
00:59
and family roles and how did new
01:02
inventions transform the production of
01:04
goods that to me is screaming like a
01:06
short answer question new inventions in
01:09
their impact cake has a 4.2 Roman
01:12
numeral 1 States new transportation
01:13
systems and technologies dramatically
01:15
expanded manufacturing and agricultural
01:18
production so let's talk about what the
01:20
heck the market revolution is is
01:22
revolution transportation communication
01:24
and the production of goods what is the
01:27
impact of this well we have manufactured
01:28
goods become more organized and we've
01:31
the emergence of factory systems such as
01:33
the Lowell factory system in Lowell
01:36
Massachusetts in which saw young single
01:38
women work in factories so this is
01:41
important we increasingly see the
01:42
production of goods going from homes to
01:45
factories let's jump into some new
01:47
innovations but before we do I want to
01:49
let you know I do have a video in the
01:50
description that goes over these in
01:52
detail so for textile machinery we have
01:54
things like the spinning jenny and
01:56
Samuel Slater was this really important
01:58
dude from England who disguises himself
02:00
and he sneaks out the country comes to
02:02
America
02:02
these notice of the father of the
02:04
American factory system because he
02:06
memorized plans for a spinning jenny and
02:08
also helped build factories in the
02:10
united states interchangeable parts by
02:12
Eli winning this led to
02:13
mass production of goods because all the
02:15
parts were identical and could be easily
02:18
replaced if broken the Telegraph helps
02:21
spread information across the country
02:22
via Morse code and we have agricultural
02:25
inventions you should be familiar with
02:26
such as the steel plow by this dude John
02:28
Deere this would break soil and allow
02:30
farmers to plant crops more easily the
02:34
McCormick Reaper allowed them to harvest
02:36
crops more easily when they were done
02:38
growing and the cotton gin is well also
02:41
invented by Eli Whitney we have him
02:43
again this was used to separate seeds
02:45
from the cotton and this drastically
02:47
increased the demand for not only cotton
02:49
but slavery as well it really doesn't
02:52
matter which one of these inventions
02:53
were talking about they all increase
02:55
production efficiency so cotton is being
02:58
produced a much more efficient rate
03:00
manufactured goods are because of
03:02
interchangeable parts the development of
03:05
infrastructure is huge during this time
03:07
in American history we have roads such
03:09
as the Cumberland Road which originally
03:10
connected Cumberland Maryland to Ohio
03:13
and then is extended as far as Illinois
03:16
later on and this was paid for by the
03:18
federal government because this involves
03:20
interstate commerce or trade between two
03:23
or more states as an example of an
03:26
interstate improvement canals
03:28
specifically the Erie Canal which
03:30
connected Albany to Buffalo and really
03:32
New York City via the Hudson River as
03:33
well this was paid for entirely by New
03:35
York State because this is an example of
03:37
intrastate trade or trade only within
03:39
one single State railroads would be an
03:42
over arrow this is what the first
03:43
railroads it connected Baltimore to Ohio
03:45
and many others would spring up
03:47
throughout throughout the country as the
03:49
years went on and many of these projects
03:51
were paid for by state and local
03:53
governments not the federal government's
03:56
money these were paid for by state and
03:57
local and private corporations as well
03:59
so what is the impact of all this well
04:01
we see that two regions in particular
04:04
the north and the Midwest they will be
04:05
more closely connected than the south
04:08
the south will really kind of be left up
04:09
because they're so focused on
04:10
plantations and the north and the
04:13
Midwest will be will be the
04:14
beneficiaries of this infrastructure
04:17
okay let's jump over to Roman numeral
04:19
two four key cuts at four point two the
04:21
changes caused by the market revolution
04:23
had significant effects on the u.s.
04:24
society workers
04:26
lives and gender and family relations so
04:29
we see a shift from subsistence farming
04:31
or farming just to feed yourself now
04:33
people begin to farm to sell crops at
04:36
massive rates not just cash crops like
04:38
cotton but food as well more men and
04:41
women begin to work in factories no
04:43
longer just in the homes were a lot of
04:44
goods were produced I talked about
04:46
earlier and early factories were built
04:48
near water here is Lowell Massachusetts
04:50
which at one time was the second most
04:52
powerful manufacturing city really in
04:54
the entire world and it's important
04:56
during the cent that factories are built
04:57
near water as a source of power for the
04:59
machines and they would produce goods
05:01
for distant markets not only in the
05:03
United States but in various parts of
05:05
the world as well what's impact in
05:08
manufacturing and the market revolution
05:09
well we have a growing middle class we
05:12
also have a widening gap between the
05:14
rich and the poor we have very few
05:16
people who have a lot of money we have
05:17
this growing group of poor people as
05:20
well there's also a change in gender and
05:22
family roles middle-class women the
05:24
expectation was that they would not work
05:26
outside the home and this was held up by
05:29
the city of the cult of domesticity this
05:30
promoted separate spheres for men and
05:33
women and really a woman sphere belongs
05:34
at home not outside the home in work and
05:37
here is a magazine Gotti's ladybug
05:40
throughout the the 19th century that
05:42
really helped reinforce this idea of the
05:44
cult of domesticity okay we'll finish up
05:46
a four point two Roman numeral three
05:47
economic development shape settlements
05:49
settlement and trade patterns helping to
05:52
unify the nation while also encouraging
05:53
the growth of different regions so we
05:56
see a wave of immigrants coming in from
05:57
Europe and they tended to settle in the
05:59
East and the Midwest and there's two
06:01
groups in particular you should be
06:02
familiar with and we'll talk more about
06:03
them in period five but we'll introduce
06:05
them here and as a result of these
06:07
groups we see increased interdependence
06:09
between the Northeast and the Old
06:11
Northwest because Germans would send on
06:14
the old Northwest at in the frontier in
06:17
places like Ohio as farmers in the Irish
06:20
they would settle in the east and cities
06:22
as urban workers so we really see a
06:25
connection between the East and the the
06:27
Midwest of the Old Northwest a Metis
06:30
Irish escaped Ireland in the 1840s and
06:32
1850s because of the Irish potato famine
06:35
and this forced many Irish to flee
06:38
Ireland
06:39
and many died in Ireland as well new
06:42
cities began to emerge along the Ohio
06:44
and Mississippi River cities such as st.
06:46
Louis and Cincinnati in Cincinnati's and
06:49
nickname was porkopolis and here is an
06:50
early painting of Cincinnati my favorite
06:53
city
06:53
they became centers for meatpacking then
06:56
later on Chicago will as well but a lot
06:58
of cities begin to develop along these
06:59
very powerful popular rivers so we see
07:03
this emergence of national ties between
07:05
the north and the south cotton
07:07
production and the south is enormous and
07:10
this would be shipped to northern
07:11
factories and made into different
07:13
textiles banks would provide funding for
07:15
both factories and plantations in the
07:18
south as well as equipment for
07:19
plantations and then we have the
07:21
emergence of a distinctive Southern
07:23
identity the South continued to rely on
07:25
cash crops so much so that the South's
07:27
nickname was king cotton because they
07:29
produce so much cotton and they made so
07:31
much money from it plantation owners had
07:33
tremendous power both economically and
07:35
politically as well and they made sure
07:37
that their own interests were advanced
07:38
and many elites defended slavery john c
07:41
calhoun he gave a speech in 1837 which
07:45
he identified slavery as a positive good
07:47
in hierarchy that was positive for the
07:49
slaves and these are arguments that the
07:51
south use to justify slavery there were
07:55
hopes to unify the US economy most
07:57
notably Henry Clay's American system I
07:59
do have a video in the description of
08:00
that on there three parts is the second
08:02
bank of the United States building up
08:04
infrastructure through roads and canals
08:06
as we've talked about and that would be
08:08
funded by tariffs and tariffs our taxes
08:11
on imported goods and what this does is
08:13
it tends to be favored by people in the
08:15
north in the Midwest and not the south
08:17
so just like the market revolution and
08:19
an infrastructure tends to benefit the
08:21
north and the Midwest more than the
08:23
south the American system is the same
08:25
and the South in particular will dislike
08:28
the American system because of tariffs
08:30
that benefited industry and not
08:32
agriculture all right we'll finish up
08:34
with some tests tips for multiple choice
08:35
and short answer be able to identify and
08:38
explain the impact of the market
08:39
revolution the impact on wealth in this
08:42
country the growing gap between the rich
08:43
and poor as well as gender and family
08:45
roles and the impact of technology and
08:47
industry and agriculture and goals of
08:50
the Americans goals and impacts of the
08:52
American
08:53
system for essay questions it could be
08:55
about the market revolution in general
08:57
and reasons for sectional tensions and
08:59
the emerge of unique regional identities
09:01
during this time all right guys look
09:04
forward to see ray back here for key
09:05
concept four point three which we will
09:07

section I'll get to it in a future video
00:30
all right he cuts up 4.3 states the US
00:33
interest in increasing foreign trade in
00:35
expanding its national borders shape the
00:37
nation's foreign policy and spurred
00:39
government and private initiatives
00:41
that's from page 50 if you haven't
00:43
downloaded this yet check in link in the
00:45
description you need to know this so
00:47
it's a big idea questions you should be
00:48
able to answer at the conclusion of this
00:50
video what was the message of an impact
00:53
of the Monroe Doctrine and how did
00:55
westward expansion lead to conflicts
00:58
over slavery that will be a theme
01:00
continuing into period 5 as well make
01:03
sure you know that and understand it
01:05
right he cuts up four point three Roman
01:07
numeral one struggling to create an
01:09
independent global presence the United
01:11
States sought to clean territory
01:12
throughout the North American continent
01:14
and promote foreign trade that is also
01:16
from page 50 so what we'll see is that
01:18
after the Louisiana Purchase the US will
01:20
seek to increase its influence in North
01:22
America through the following ways with
01:25
exploration right after a few years
01:27
after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 we
01:29
have the Lewis and Clark expedition in
01:31
Lewis and Clark were aides to Jefferson
01:33
and they sought to find a waterway to
01:35
this Pacific Ocean obviously they never
01:38
found that but they did gain immense
01:40
knowledge about the environment and
01:41
natives on the land they just purchased
01:44
from the French military actions were
01:48
another way to increase influence we
01:49
have their roost ik war which settled
01:51
the main Canada boundary dispute so our
01:54
present-day boundaries between Maine and
01:56
Canada were established as a result of
01:58
this in the 1830s we have American
02:00
Indian Removal as well the Indian
02:02
Removal Act of 1830 which led to later
02:05
the Trail of Tears which forced many
02:07
natives to move west of the Mississippi
02:09
River and here is a map of the
02:11
the forced removal Native Americans to
02:14
go beyond the Mississippi River into
02:17
present-day Oklahoma
02:19
there were diplomatic efforts as well
02:21
specifically the Monroe Doctrine which
02:23
warned Europe to stay out of the Western
02:25
Hemisphere President James Monroe
02:27
through the Monroe Doctrine basically
02:29
said Europe you guys have a different
02:31
government than us you are not to try to
02:33
recolonize any of these newly
02:35
independent nations in latin america and
02:38
you need to stay out of the western
02:39
hemisphere and in return the United
02:42
States would stay out of European
02:43
affairs and here's a great political
02:45
cartoon that illustrates the Monroe
02:47
Doctrine you'll notice that the US
02:49
according to this cartoon has Uncle
02:52
Sam's hat right in Latin America so this
02:54
will increase the USA's involvement in
02:56
Latin America for in years to come as we
02:59
shall see those that were living on the
03:01
frontier tended to favor expansion those
03:04
Americans and this would allow for more
03:06
land to be available for farming now
03:08
with expansion comes resistance by
03:10
Native Americans we have the Black Hawk
03:12
War which was in Illinois in 1832 and
03:15
Abe Lincoln was actually part of this
03:17
although he did not see any combat
03:19
Native Americans they sought to gain
03:21
land that they ceded to the government
03:23
the US government in 1804 back they were
03:26
unsuccessful in the Seminole Wars this
03:29
was a series of wars in the early to mid
03:31
nineteenth century the first Seminole
03:33
war forced natives for Seminole natives
03:36
of Florida to move to Central Florida
03:38
and then the second one will see the
03:40
removal of the Seminoles from Florida so
03:43
we see here where the u.s. is expanding
03:45
there will be many calls for from
03:47
Americans to remove Native Americans
03:49
from this land Cocozza four point three
03:52
Roman numeral two states the United
03:54
States acquisition of lands in the West
03:56
gave rise to contests over the extension
03:59
of slavery into new territories so
04:01
there's a spread of the plantation
04:03
slavery
04:04
west of the Appalachian Mountains now
04:06
let's think back we first were
04:08
introduced to the Appalachian Mountains
04:10
in 1763 do you remember why they were so
04:13
important in 1763 you know this that's
04:16
right the proclamation line of 1763
04:18
which the British government said the
04:20
colonists could not expand West a very
04:22
good nice memory
04:23
so the deep south refers also known as
04:26
the condo this refers to new states like
04:28
Mississippi Alabama Louisiana which had
04:31
a lot of fertile soil for the production
04:33
of cotton many slaveholders began to
04:37
move to more fertile land west of
04:39
Appalachians because cotton similar to
04:41
tobacco from colonial days that
04:43
exhausted the land it destroyed the land
04:45
there's a constant need for new fertile
04:48
soil now during this time we begin to
04:50
see anti-slavery efforts increase in the
04:52
north and it's important to note that
04:53
women's rights in abolitionism were
04:55
closely linked those two reform
04:57
movements were very very closely linked
04:59
I can't stress enough you need to know
05:01
that an example is lydia maria child she
05:04
was an abolitionist and a women's rights
05:06
advocate we also have a very well-known
05:09
author from New England William Lloyd
05:11
Garrison who published a weekly
05:12
newspaper from 1831 to 1865 called the
05:16
Liberator and this advocated the
05:19
immediate and uncompensated end to
05:21
slavery he wanted slavery to end now
05:24
today this moment and slave owners he
05:27
believes should not be paid or
05:28
compensated for the loss of their slaves
05:31
now jump on over to slavery in the south
05:34
and three out of four people in the
05:36
south did not own slaves however the
05:38
institution was very prolific down in
05:41
the South slavery was defended by many
05:43
southern leaders and writers we talked
05:45
about key concept four point two video
05:47
this guy dracula i mean john c calhoun
05:50
argued that slavery was a positive good
05:52
a very well known writer George Fitzhugh
05:54
would write about slavery in terms of
05:56
being better than factory workers in the
05:58
north so a lot of people in the south
06:00
began to defend slavery during this time
06:02
and actually called it a good or
06:04
positive thing the Missouri Compromise
06:06
is also known as the Compromise of 1820
06:08
and there are three parts you have to
06:10
know all three parts I have a detailed
06:11
video as well in this in the description
06:13
make sure you check it out one Missouri
06:16
would enter the country as a slave state
06:18
so there this is the first state carved
06:20
out of Louisiana Purchase territory that
06:22
wants to enter the United States as a
06:24
slave state this would tip the balance
06:26
in favor of the slave states so part of
06:29
the compromise would allow for Maine to
06:31
enter the country as a free state Maine
06:33
once belonged to Massachusetts
06:35
now it's its own state and is
06:37
emerging as a free state then we also
06:40
have this line known as a 36:30 line and
06:42
it is right here below Missouri
06:46
everything above this in the future all
06:48
this green territory over here would be
06:50
emitted as free everything below it down
06:53
here would be mid emitted as slave
06:56
states this is the third part of the
06:58
compromise now eventually we'll find out
07:00
period five this this gets overturned
07:02
now the impact is attention still
07:05
existed there's it was a temporary
07:06
solution between defenders and
07:08
supporters of slavery people like Thomas
07:10
Jefferson absolutely hated the Missouri
07:12
Compromise
07:13
he talks about it this geographical line
07:16
will never be obliterated and every new
07:19
irritation will mark it deeper and
07:21
deeper so he was arguing that this will
07:23
divide the north and the south and he
07:26
was right then the 1850s tensions would
07:28
come to the forefront we'll eventually
07:29
see the Missouri Compromise is repealed
07:32
but it was a temporary solution to the
07:34
issue of slavery in the territories okay
07:38
let's go over some test steps worried
07:39
for multiple choice and short answer be
07:42
able to identify and explain examples of
07:44
us seeking dominance in North America
07:46
and the Western Hemisphere the Monroe
07:48
Doctrine and the removal of Native
07:50
Americans as well conflicts with Native
07:52
Americans be able to identify and
07:54
describe one of them one or two of them
07:56
the Missouri Compromise absolutely know
07:58
all three parts and that it was a
08:00
temporary solution and four essay
08:02
questions what were the impacts of
08:04
westward expansion on natives and on
08:06
tensions between the north and the south
08:08
which of course would include slavery
08:10
all right guys look forward to seeing
08:12
right back here four key concept five
08:14
point one in which we will talk about
08:16
manifest destiny very important topic
08:18
that will help lead to this civil war I
08:21

00:29
what's up a.push peeps we have the
00:32
second party system this is going to be
00:34
a Jackson and Henry Clay centred video
00:37
and this is a very important part of the
00:40
new a.push curriculum this to me screams
00:43
a short answer question so make sure you
00:45
are familiar with it all right so let's
00:48
all talk about the 1820s 1830s we have
00:50
the rise of new political party
00:52
specifically the Whigs led by Henry Clay
00:54
that's going to be in the 1830s and the
00:56
Democrats in the 1820s led by Andrew
00:58
Jackson now this time saw increased
01:01
political participation you see this
01:04
through the elimination of property
01:05
requirements for adult white male so you
01:08
do see a large number of adult white
01:10
males voting that's the increase of
01:12
political participation but of course we
01:14
still have a large portion of the
01:16
American population that can not vote
01:18
African Americans women now the
01:21
differences between the two parties that
01:22
you should know is that their debates
01:24
over the role and power of the federal
01:26
government should the federal government
01:28
be strong should it be weak the National
01:31
Bank or the second bet boss or the Bank
01:33
of the United States this was a huge
01:35
issue between these two also tariffs or
01:38
taxes on imported goods and federally
01:40
funded internal improvements or the
01:43
federal government pain for
01:44
infrastructure now the last three here
01:47
this is really going to be Henry Clay's
01:49
American system so what we'll find is
01:52
that the Whigs generally support these
01:54
three things and the Democrats generally
01:56
are against these three things so it's
01:59
about the role and power of the federal
02:01
government Whigs tended to favor a
02:02
stronger central government and they
02:04
would support Henry Clay's American
02:06
system the National Boss internal
02:08
improvements and the protective tariffs
02:10
again make sure you know all three parts
02:13
of the American system I do have a video
02:16
in the description of the American
02:17
system check it out if you want more
02:19
info Democrats they tended to favor more
02:22
power to four states and they would
02:24
oppose the American system so that's one
02:26
major difference between the two parties
02:28
the National Bank or the second bus
02:31
Andrew Jackson he's going to veto a
02:35
recharter of this I could bus which
02:37
would essentially be the third one in
02:38
1832 and this is going to lead to some
02:40
called the bank warned I do have a video
02:42
on that as well now the wigs Henry Clay
02:45
they're going to really join in crew
02:46
they're going to create this new
02:47
political party the Whigs in response to
02:51
what they called King Andrew the
02:52
firstness is a very famous political
02:54
cartoon because what's unique about this
02:56
is adrianne vetoed the bus and this was
02:59
the first time a president vetoed
03:01
something because he didn't like it not
03:04
because he thought it was
03:05
unconstitutional he vetoed it because he
03:07
personally did not like it and you see
03:09
here in his left hand he has a veto in
03:12
there and many people thought that he
03:15
was abusing his power so key questions
03:18
you should ask yourself anytime you see
03:20
a political cartoon is who would agree
03:22
with this who would disagree with this
03:24
so obviously the creator of this cartoon
03:26
would most likely sympathize with the
03:29
Whigs and would not sympathize with the
03:32
Democrats so maybe a northern banker
03:35
would love this cartoon because it is
03:37
criticizing Andrew Jackson but maybe a
03:40
farmer who was refused a loan by the
03:42
Bank of the United States would disagree
03:45
with this because they thought Andrew
03:48
Jackson was good for killing the bus all
03:51
right let's jump on over to tariffs
03:52
tariffs are a tax on imported goods they
03:54
tended to be favored in the north and by
03:56
industries and disliked by the South
03:58
because tariffs tended to protect
03:59
businesses in the north Whigs tended to
04:02
support them and Democrats did not you
04:04
could already tell that because of the
04:06
American system tariff of 1828 and 1832
04:09
work were really hot bed topics during
04:13
this time they were high tariff rates
04:15
and Dracula who was the vice president I
04:18
mean John C Calhoun who was the vice
04:19
president to Andrew Jackson he was from
04:21
South Carolina and he wrote the South
04:23
Carolina exposition in protests he was
04:25
against these high tariffs and look at
04:28
him yet you see the resemblance there
04:29
it's identical so in 1833 we have a
04:31
compromise tariff of 1833 in which the
04:34
tariff rates are lowered over eight
04:36
years and that is the second of three
04:38
major compromises by Henry Clay really
04:41
the country was close to Civil War
04:43
during this time let's jump on over to
04:45
federally funded internal improvement is
04:47
a key component of Henry Clay's American
04:49
system this means that the federal
04:52
government would pay for infrastructure
04:54
actually when it came to states in it
04:57
and there were debates over whether the
04:59
federal government should fund
05:00
intrastate or one state improvement
05:03
Henry Clay favored that people who were
05:05
against this did not they thought the
05:07
federal government should only pay for
05:08
improvements that would benefit more
05:11
than one state or interstate commerce
05:13
so Andrew Jackson he will veto the
05:17
Maysville Road bill which would provide
05:19
federal funds for a road that is solely
05:22
in Kentucky and many Whigs were upset
05:26
about this so Jackson is pretty much
05:28
like sorry bro no improvements for you
05:29
because you are Kentucky you are one
05:31
state that's intra not interstate
05:34
commerce alright let's finish up with
05:36
some tests tips for multiple choice and
05:37
short answer no the causes of the rise
05:40
of the second party system I could see
05:42
this as a short answer question
05:45
differences between the two parties what
05:47
are they who would support them
05:48
characteristics of supporters and for
05:50
essays almost any essay in the
05:52
antebellum time period you could fit
05:53
these political parties into it and a
05:56
possible synthesis point could be
05:58
connecting this to debates during the
05:59
first party system so for example there
06:02
were debates about the bank of the
06:03
United States during the second party
06:05
system as there were in the first party
06:08
system short answer question I will
06:10
leave you with and you would answer all
06:12
three parts briefly explain how one of
06:14
the following was most significant in
06:16
the formation of political parties in
06:18
the early 19th century again Whigs and
06:20
Democrats National Bank tariffs
06:22
federally funded internal improvements
06:24
ladies gentleman this is straight from
06:25
the new curriculum so you could see a
06:27
short answer question like this provide
06:29
one piece of historical evidence that
06:31
supports your choice in Part A and
06:34
briefly explain why one of the other
06:36
options is not as significant in the
06:39
formation of political parties in the
06:40
early 19th century so you have to create
06:42
an argument as to why one is a
06:45
significant cause for the creation of
06:47
parties and one of these is not as
06:49
significant all right guys thank you
06:50
very much for watching best of luck on
06:52
all of your exams especially the one in

May and make sure you are familiar with

Oh what's going down a push peeps we

have a quick video for you today but a
00:07
very important one this one is going to
00:09
focus on technology and transportation
00:11
during the market revolution things that
00:14
are specifically mentioned in the new
00:16
curriculum so make sure you are familiar
00:18
with it before you begin its shout out
00:20
time shout out to several classes we mr.

00:35
this year as well as everybody watching
00:38
you want to shout out for your teacher
00:39
leave it in the comment section below
00:42
alright let's start off talking about
00:43
what the heck is the market revolution
00:44
well it's a revolution in transportation
00:46
farming and production of goods we see
00:50
an increased use of canals roads stoom
00:52
steamboats and railroads during this
00:54
time we also see a switch from
00:56
subsistence to cash crop farming so no
00:59
longer are people growing food just to
01:01
survive off of they're growing it to
01:03
sell and we also see that group goods
01:06
are produced increasingly outside the
01:08
home so we begin to see a switch towards
01:11
factories and this occurs prior to the
01:13
Civil War which is antebellum America
01:16
the word Antebellum means prior to the
01:19
Civil War okay let's talk about some
01:20
transportation improvements for roads we
01:23
have the Cumberland or the National Road
01:25
and it originally went from Maryland all
01:29
the way over to Ohio knit since was
01:31
added on a lot more stretching all the
01:33
way over to Illinois and this was funded
01:35
by the federal government because it
01:37
connected two or more states and that's
01:39
an example of interstate so the federal
01:42
government it's going to be lots of
01:43
debates during this time should the
01:44
federal government provide funding for
01:46
transportation the federal government
01:49
will if it's an example of inter or two
01:51
or more states so if it's just one state
01:53
that benefits from it chances are the
01:55
government will not but if it's many
01:57
states that benefit two or more than
01:59
they will an example of an intrastate
02:03
project is the Erie Canal we see lots of
02:06
canals popping up but none that are more
02:08
important during this time than the Erie
02:09
Canal is 363 miles long and it connected
02:13
Albany to Buffalo and here is the city
02:16
of Lockport near Buffalo it's about 20
02:18
minutes from my house here is a
02:19
depiction of Lockport named after the
02:22
locks on the canal this was paid
02:24
entirely by New York State because this
02:26
is intrastate is within one state the
02:29
original plan called for the federal
02:31
government to fund it in James Monroe
02:34
vetoed it because it was only within the
02:37
state he thought it was unconstitutional
02:38
now eventually there a canal is going to
02:40
connect New York City via the Hudson
02:42
River all the way over to the Midwest
02:45
another improvement transportation we
02:47
have is the steamboat and here is a
02:49
replica of one of the first steamboats
02:50
and it was really became popular due to
02:53
Robert Fulton and there's a lot of boats
02:55
to travel against the current no longer
02:58
did they have to go downstream with
03:00
whatever direction the current went now
03:01
they could travel against and goods it
03:03
can be shipped in multiple directions
03:05
alright let's jump over to agricultural
03:08
improvements we have the cotton gin
03:09
invented by Eli Whitney and this
03:12
drastically increased cotton production
03:14
and the demand for slaves in the south
03:16
and what the cotton gin does is kind of
03:18
has these seeds in it and you would put
03:20
the cognate here this machine would
03:22
separate the seeds from the cotton
03:24
itself and what we see is this gigantic
03:28
explosion and the demand for cotton in
03:30
the amount of cotton that is produced
03:32
this steel plow is amended by this dude
03:35
John Deere this allowed farmers to break
03:38
soil more easily and begin planting and
03:40
this is especially beneficial to farmers
03:42
in the Midwest who would focus on
03:44
growing wheat another invention is the
03:47
McCormick Reaper and here is an
03:48
illustration of it and farmers could
03:50
harvest crops more quickly and the key
03:53
thing to think with all these inventions
03:54
inventions is that efficiency is going
03:57
to increase for the McCormick Reaper the
04:00
efficiency of harvesting will increase
04:02
for farmers drastically alright let's
04:05
jump over to technological improvements
04:07
interchangeable parts we have Eli
04:08
Whitney again here he is he is really
04:10
credited with interchangeable parts and
04:13
what this does is creates cookie-cutter
04:15
parts I use this analogy if I ask you to
04:17
make a star shaped cookie you're star
04:20
shaped cookie may look a lot different
04:22
from mine when an interchangeable part
04:24
does is it makes all of these look ident
04:26
so if I give you a star shaped cookie
04:29
cutter all of your cookies would look
04:31
the same so this will allow goods to be
04:34
produced with identical parts and this
04:36
leads to the mass production of goods in
04:38
increased production and efficiency
04:40
rates especially for things like guns
04:43
and other forms of manufactured goods we
04:47
have the Telegraph which was used to
04:49
communicate Morse code in here Samuel
04:51
Morse and in 1844 we have the first
04:53
transmission and the first transmission
04:55
said what hath God wrought and that is
04:58
also the name of a Pulitzer
04:59
prize-winning book I suggest you check
05:02
out that's all about this time period
05:03
and this drastically increased
05:05
communication in the United States so
05:07
information is spread much faster that
05:09
will play a very important role during
05:11
the Civil War generals can now
05:13
communicate with Abe Lincoln in the
05:14
White House and transmit information
05:16
quickly all right let's go over some
05:19
test steps for multiple choices short
05:20
answer no specific inventions and be
05:23
able to explain the impact especially by
05:26
the region so know that the cotton gin
05:28
for example at a drastic impact on the
05:31
south especially as manifest destiny is
05:33
occurring in the u.s. is expanding
05:35
though the interchangeable parts will
05:37
have a large impact on the north and
05:39
factory for essay topics this could be a
05:41
part of a broader essay about the market
05:44
revolution and regional specialization
05:46
again what inventions benefit the north
05:48
been to the south and benefited the west
05:51
all right guys thank you very much for
05:52
watching I do appreciate hopefully you
05:54
check out other videos in the
05:56
description that relate to this time
05:58
period and best of luck on all your
06:00
tests this year especially the one in
06:02
May have a good day

00:03
hey what's up ap guys we have a video
00:06
for you on the Nullification Crisis
00:07
which occurs during Andrew Jackson's
00:09
presidencies one of my favorite times in
00:12
US history before we get started I want
00:14
to introduce you to a quote I read by
00:17
Andrew Jackson while reading this
00:19
wonderful book on my political hero
00:21
Henry Clay statesman for the Union by
00:23
renowned a Jackson scholar Robert Remini
00:27
and the very first page I saw this quote
00:30
and here's Andrew Jackson when he was
00:33
close to his death he was asked if he
00:35
had left anything undone
00:37
yes Jackson replied I didn't shoot Henry
00:41
Clay and I didn't hang John C Calhoun
00:44
those are some strong words there for
00:46
edge Jackson now much of his resentment
00:48
towards Henry Clay started with the
00:50
corrupt bargain and virtually all of his
00:53
resentment towards John C Cajon can be
00:55
traced back to this let's find out what
00:57
did John see Calhoun do that may dad
00:59
Andrew Jackson want to hang him alright
01:03
before we get started with the tariff
01:05
controversy we need to do a brief review
01:07
of tariffs and remember a tariff is a
01:10
tax on foreign goods now what a tariff
01:13
does is it raises the price of foreign
01:16
made products and in theory this will
01:18
help out with American businesses
01:20
because now foreign products are more
01:22
expensive it also will provide a source
01:25
of revenue for the government who would
01:27
favor tariffs well the Northwood because
01:30
they have industry and that's where a
01:31
lot of manufacturing takes place and
01:33
those that would be against tariffs
01:35
would be the south and then some people
01:37
in the West as well there's little
01:39
industry and they are consumers so they
01:41
would be hurt by these high prices okay
01:45
let's go to the tariff of 1828 also
01:47
known as the tariff of abominations this
01:49
is passed in 1828 and hopes to hurt
01:51
President Adams this was actually
01:53
devised by a bunch of jacks Jackson
01:56
supporters who they wanted a turf to be
01:58
so high that President John Adams would
02:00
have to veto it and if he vetoed it that
02:02
he would alienate his base in the north
02:05
thus guaranteeing the election the
02:08
presidential election of 1828 two jacks
02:10
and however Adam signs it he does
02:12
alienate himself in
02:13
South in the West but he keeps that base
02:16
in the north and this raises tariff
02:18
rates significantly let's take a look at
02:21
this we have way up here is the tariff
02:24
of 1828 48 percent on some Goods it is
02:28
very very high the highest tariffs up to
02:31
that time by far again the northern
02:34
industries are going to favor this and
02:35
the southerners are going to be hurt by
02:36
this tariff and the southerners receive
02:39
no tariff protection protection for
02:41
their goods predominantly cotton so they
02:44
felt like why are we getting a bone
02:46
thrown our way here enter John C Calhoun
02:49
well he is part of the great trial but
02:50
here's another great book by Merrill
02:53
Petersen and it is all about these three
02:56
interesting med but my favorite right
02:58
here in the middle
02:59
Henry Clay there John Seco who is also
03:01
the vice president under both President
03:03
Adams and President Jackson so he served
03:06
under two different presidents he goes
03:08
on to become a senator from South
03:09
Carolina he was also a Warhawk leading
03:11
to the war of 1812 and a very scary
03:15
individual he did not age well
03:16
whatsoever he kind of looks like Dracula
03:18
or something I don't know know somebody
03:20
in the Airness he looks like doctor I'm
03:22
a brown I don't agree but by the way
03:23
that is my favorite movie of all time
03:25
maybe you see the resemblance I don't
03:27
Ron for a Marty okay he also wrote a a
03:31
pamphlet called the South Carolina
03:33
exposition and protest very important to
03:36
know he wrote this anonymously while he
03:39
was vice president he drew inspiration
03:40
from the Virginia and Kentucky
03:42
resolutions and what he said in this was
03:45
for states to nullify the tariff of
03:47
abominations for the tariff of 1828 two
03:52
years later in 1830 in the Senate we
03:54
have something called that Webster hain
03:55
debate which which is very very symbolic
03:58
and very very important at this time
03:59
Daniel Webster also part of the great
04:02
triumvirate supported the Union it was
04:04
critical of cries of secession hain here
04:07
who goes on who goes on to become
04:09
governor of South Carolina was buddies
04:11
with John C Calhoun and he was
04:12
encouraging people to nullify the
04:14
tariffs and then they were even some
04:16
some chants of secession here breaking
04:19
away and Webster was notorious for
04:22
wanting to preserve the Union and this
04:24
is a very very famous debate that will
04:26
unite the door
04:27
for many years to come here we have the
04:30
tariff of 1832 and this lowered the
04:33
rates from the tariff of abominations
04:34
how why were the sounds like nope still
04:37
too high bro you gotta lower them even
04:38
more so South Carolina calls a state
04:40
convention and they officially know if
04:42
either tariff of 1832 it and this sets
04:45
the stage for a showdown nullification a
04:48
reminder is the act of making something
04:50
void specifically the action of a state
04:52
in
04:53
abrogating a federal law on the basis of
04:56
state sovereignty in other words a state
04:58
nullifying or declaring a federal law
05:01
unconstitutional in South Carolina in
05:04
addition to nullify net said to Jackson
05:06
in Washington DC hey if you try to
05:08
collect these tariffs we will break away
05:10
we will threaten secession they threaten
05:13
secession so a hero is needed and who is
05:17
going to come save the day oh my god it
05:20
is super clay rhyme that was pretty done
05:23
so this is the great compromisers second
05:26
compromise and this is known as a
05:28
compromise tariff of 1833 so over the
05:31
next eight years the tariff rates will
05:33
gradually lower by ten percent per year
05:36
so if we look back at this chart you see
05:39
that each one of these little steps here
05:41
is the rate lowering ten percent per
05:44
year and you see 33 34 35 36 those are
05:48
the year so 10% per year and then it's
05:51
going to go all the way back to the
05:53
tariff of 1816 to the rates of the
05:57
tariff of 1816 the south will favor this
05:59
and Jackson and the same day that the
06:02
tariff of 1833 is passed the force bill
06:05
is passed which was introduced by Andrew
06:07
Jackson and what the force bill says is
06:10
that the president could use the
06:12
military to collect tariffs in the
06:14
future if necessary so it was a way for
06:16
Andrew Jackson to kind of get his way as
06:18
well and both Jackson and Calhoun were
06:21
able to say faced with this they both
06:23
were able to claim victory on some level
06:25
the crisis is averted but the real hero
06:27
here is Henry Clay alright that's
06:31
everything you need to know about the
06:32
nullification crisis I hope that helped
06:34
take a moment to subscribe spread the
06:36
word for me please let people know in
06:38

got a good one for you today this is on
00:03
antebellum era reforms a very popular
00:06
topic make sure you know you'll see it
00:08
on your exam
00:09
before I begin at shout out time I want
00:10
to give shout outs to mr. Mayes lends a

luck this year you're all brilliant and
00:24
will do great all right second grade
00:27
awakened we're gonna start off with this
00:29
was a religious revival movement of the
00:31
1800s you have people like Charles G
00:33
Finney who was a traveling preacher and
00:35
really preached throughout much of the
00:38
United States especially in the New York
00:40
and Midwest area of Ohio he converted
00:43
many people in what was known as the
00:45
burned-over district because so many
00:47
people converted of western New York of
00:49
the Rochester Erie Canal area and the
00:52
big thing to no star the circle
00:54
underline highlighter whatever you have
00:56
to do my class I better be see a circle
00:59
on this tomorrow when I check your video
01:01
guys this influenced reform movements I
01:04
can't stress enough the Second Great
01:05
Awakening is going to influence a lot of
01:08
reform movements make sure you know that
01:10
for your tests okay transcendentalism
01:12
this is the individual experience focus
01:15
on reasoning unreason in understanding
01:17
some famous transcendentalist you have
01:19
Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote several
01:23
writings including nature that
01:25
individual should be in harmony with
01:26
nature Henry David Thoreau with arguably
01:29
the greatest neckbeard in the history of
01:31
the United States he authored civil
01:34
disobedience and he believed that a
01:35
government that violates morality has no
01:37
authority and this will go on to inspire
01:39
Gandhi and Martin Luther King so very
01:42
influential person not only in US
01:44
history but world history as well okay
01:46
Toby in societies these were communal
01:49
societies in the 19th century of Brooke
01:51
farm in Massachusetts founded by George
01:53
Ripley and community members shared in
01:56
the work and in leisure so the Goldie's
01:59
can of these utopian societies was to
02:01
basically have perfection in little
02:04
societies New Harmony founded in Indiana
02:07
saw members work and live in equality
02:10
including females they had many rights
02:12
during that time
02:14
jumping on over to temperance now we're
02:16
getting into the reform movements that
02:17
were inspired by what yeah you genius
02:20
there you go again you know it it's a
02:22
second Great Awakening this was a
02:24
movement to limit the consumption of
02:25
alcohol especially hard liquor and the
02:28
American Temperance Society saw over 1
02:30
million members that pledge to abstain
02:32
from liquor so this was very popular
02:35
during Antebellum or pre-civil war
02:37
America Lyman Beecher who was the father
02:40
to Harriet Beecher Stowe was a notable
02:44
member and there is Lyman Beecher and
02:45
we'll talk more about Harriet Beecher
02:47
Stowe in another video and in 1851 Maine
02:49
past the first dry law in America or the
02:53
first law banning alcohol so we'll talk
02:57
more about prohibition which is
02:58
eliminating all alcohol that really kind
03:00
of gets its roots in the temperance
03:02
movement of the mid 19th century ok jump
03:06
it over to education we got horseman he
03:08
is the father of education the dude
03:10
looks like a teacher me he's a snazzy
03:12
dresser too he believed that education
03:14
was important for democracy that you had
03:16
to have an educated electorate who would
03:18
be able to vote based on knowledge and
03:22
tax imported elementary schools gain
03:24
support in antebellum America but really
03:27
the quality of education was dependent
03:29
on where one lived if you were in a
03:31
rural area you wouldn't you wouldn't be
03:34
as likely to have as good of an
03:35
education as somebody who lives in a
03:37
more settled community ok asylum and
03:41
Prison Reforms we Dorothea Dix she was
03:43
instrumental reform for the mentally ill
03:45
and providing better treatment for them
03:47
debtors back then could be thrown in
03:49
jail for not paying off death so if you
03:51
had a loan if you couldn't pay it off
03:54
then you would be thrown in jail
03:55
thankfully that's not the way it is
03:57
today and new Penitentiary's were built
03:59
the first one in Auburn New York about
04:01
two and a half hours for me and these
04:02
new penitent trees were built because
04:04
old prisons were unsafe and dangerous
04:06
some of them were even former mine
04:08
shafts so imagine how crazy that had to
04:11
be staying in there alright women's
04:13
rights we're jumping over to now Seneca
04:15
Falls convention of 1848 issued the
04:17
Declaration of sentiments which stayed
04:20
that all men and women are created equal
04:23
Elizabeth Cady Stanton was the only non
04:25
Quaker that drafted
04:26
the declaration this is important
04:28
because if you remember from colonial
04:29
America Quakers gave women lots of
04:32
rights they were seen as having more
04:34
rights than other religions and at the
04:38
Seneca Falls convention the members
04:39
sought to obtain women's suffrage but
04:42
they would not obtain suffrage until
04:44
1920 with the 19th amendment ok reform
04:49
movements abolitionism I have a video
04:51
that details abolitionism so we'll just
04:53
kind of summarize it really quickly here
04:54
but be familiar with the different
04:56
tactics that abolitionists use they use
04:58
moral arguments people like Frederick
05:00
Douglas in William Lloyd Garrison they
05:02
used moral arguments against slavery
05:04
there are also people who use violence
05:06
such as Nat Turner in John Brown and
05:09
then also assisting slaves escapes
05:11
through the Underground Railroad most
05:13
notably Harriet Tubman pictured here so
05:15
be familiar with these three different
05:18
tactics that abolitionists use to help
05:21
end slavery
05:22
alright guys thanks for watching I do
05:24
appreciate it best of luck on all your
05:25

what's going on a push piece we have a

very good video for you today this one
00:03
is on abolitionism prior to the Civil

War so we're talking antebellum America
00:08
we're gonna cover a lot of abolitionists
00:10

00:31
you're awesome and you will do great
00:34
all right early abolitionism throughout
00:36
most of early American history abolition
00:39
is primarily consisted of a very small
00:41
portion of the population if you're an
00:44
abolitionist in the 1700s chances are
00:46
you were one of the you belong to more
00:48
than five three groups you would be a
00:50
free african-american a slave or a
00:53
Quaker those are really the main
00:55
abolitionists in the 1700s in the 18th
00:58
century colonization was a big goal
01:03
early on in the abolitionist movement
01:04
prior to 1830 many politicians supported
01:07
colonization efforts of former slaves in
01:10
Africa this included people like Henry
01:12
Clay Chief Justice John Marshall and
01:14
Daniel Webster in 1816 the
01:17
Americanization Society was founded and
01:19
it called for gradual emancipation so
01:22
slowly freeing slaves and movement of
01:25
these former slaves to Africa and
01:29
Liberia this country of Liberia on the
01:31
west coast of Africa was established as
01:33
a place for colonization in its capital
01:36
is Monrovia named after President James
01:38
Monroe okay now we're getting into some
01:41
abolitionists we have David Walker he
01:44
was the creator of an appeal to the
01:45
colored citizens of the world and he
01:48
wanted to mobilize blacks in the
01:50
abolitionist movement he was a harsh
01:52
critic of colonization and he used the
01:54
Bible and Declaration of Independence in
01:56
his writings as a criticism of slavery
02:00
that Turner and his famous rebellion
02:03
this led he led one of the largest slave
02:05
rebellions in history in 1831 a very
02:08
important year and as well virtually all
02:10
slavery by enslaved coats became more
02:12
correct afterwards net turner in about a
02:15
hundred people were killed as a result
02:17
of this labor violence why employ
02:20
garrison was the creator of The
02:21
Liberator the same years in that
02:22
Turner's rebellion in 1831 in it in this
02:25
weekly newspaper was published until
02:27
1865 with the passage of the 13th
02:29
amendment which outlawed slavery and
02:32
this newspaper called for the immediate
02:34
and uncompensated and to slavery what
02:37
that means is he wanted slavery to end
02:38
now and slave owners should not be paid
02:40
to give up their slaves he was against
02:43
colonization and he criticized the
02:45
Constitution because it was complicit
02:47
with slavery with big due to things like
02:49
the three-fifths compromise Frederick
02:52
Douglass was a former slave from
02:54
Maryland he was an incredible orator
02:56
supporter of women's rights and a
02:58
staunch abolitionists he was the creator
03:00
of the North Star and he had a very
03:03
famous speech which you should be
03:04
familiar with if you're using the
03:05
fill-in-the-blanks guide for this video
03:08
I have an excerpt from it
03:09
this speech was known as a fourth of
03:12
July speech and it starts off by saying
03:14
what to the American slave is your 4th
03:16
of July it is a very powerful great eggs
03:19
are something that could be seen on the
03:21
exam as well
03:23
Lydia Maria Child published an appeal in
03:25
favor of that class of Americans called
03:28
Africans from 1833 she advocated a media
03:31
and a slavery without compensation just
03:33
like William Lloyd Garrison and she
03:35
believed that women's rights and
03:37
abolitionism were intertwined this is
03:39
very important to know that many women
03:41
who are abolitionists were also women's
03:43
rights advocates Theodore weld was a
03:46
minister that preached throughout the
03:48
North the evils of slavery and he argued
03:51
that slavery was a sin and he was
03:53
instrumental in reshaping the movement
03:55
away from gradual emancipation to begin
03:58
discussing immediate emancipation this
04:00
gradual emancipation was a very big idea
04:03
in the 1800s and he really helped shift
04:06
that discussion more towards immediate
04:08
emancipation Henry Highland garnet
04:11
escaped from slavery in his youth and he
04:14
advocated slaves to rebel to achieve
04:16
freedom he was a member of the American
04:19
anti-slavery society and the founder of
04:21
the American and foreign anti-slavery
04:23
society which came later after the
04:26
can anti-slave society the American
04:29
anti-slavery society from 1833 to 1870
04:32
saw 250,000 members nationwide and
04:35
several african-americans served on the
04:37
board of directors including Theodore s
04:40
Wright a co-founder he attended
04:42
Princeton Theological Seminary and he
04:45
was a conductor on the Underground
04:46
Railroad so he helped slaves escape from
04:50
the south and he used religious
04:52
arguments against slavery also okay John
04:56
Brown know him from the Pottawatomie
04:58
Creek massacre in 1856 in Kansas but
05:02
he's most known for is his raid at
05:04
Harpers Ferry in 1859 he hope to inspire
05:07
a massive slave rebellion it did not
05:09
occur and he and his followers were
05:12
killed or put to death as a result of
05:14
this they were caught in this increased
05:16
tensions between the north and the south
05:17
this is a cause of the Civil War so the
05:21
South was afraid that many more people
05:23
in the North were like John Brown and
05:24
would inspire slave rebellions notice
05:26
that this is 1859 and the Civil War
05:29
starts in 1861 okay the Underground
05:33
Railroad was an organization that helped
05:35
slaves escape conductors were people who
05:37
helped lead slaves to safe houses
05:39
Harriet Tubman helped over 70 slaves
05:42
escaped including her parents and
05:44
herself she was a former slave and
05:46
although the number of slaves that
05:48
escaped was small it was a very powerful
05:50
symbol the Underground Railroad that was
05:52
loathe by the south so it gave a lot of
05:56
hope to many slaves okay definitely know
05:59
this slide here the abolitionist methods
06:00
there are three different ones that the
06:02
AP curriculum states so you should be
06:04
familiar with one of them is moral
06:06
arguments against slavery that's people
06:08
like Douglass garrison and weld some use
06:11
violence such as net turner and John
06:14
Brown and others helped in the assisting
06:17
of slave assisting slaves escapes and
06:20
that includes the Underground Railroad
06:21
and Harriet Tubman this to me is
06:23
screaming a short answer about different
06:26
methods used by abolitionists to help
06:29
and slavery all right for tests it's
06:32
multiple choices short answer identify
06:33
and describe different tactics use
06:35
that's what we just went over documents
06:37
Douglass is 4th of July speech is a
06:40
and for essays this could be part of
06:42
sectional tensions prior to the Civil
06:44
War all right guys thank you very much

yo what's going down on a push beef we
00:06
have key concept 5.1 for you today this
00:08
is the revised edition the most
00:11
up-to-date video you will find on key
00:13
concept 5.21 before we begin its shout

Terry's class at lchc mr. Baker's class
00:27
and MS clays class from Texas thank you
00:30
all so much for the support alright
00:32
let's take a look at key concept 5.1 it
00:34
states the United States became more
00:36
connected with the world pursued an
00:38
expansionist foreign policy in the
00:40
Western Hemisphere and he merged as a
00:41
destination for many migrants from other
00:44
countries that's from page 53 if you
00:46
want to link check the description for a
00:49
link to the curriculum framework it's a
00:52
big idea questions you should be able to
00:53
answer by the end of this video what
00:55
were the social economic and political
00:56
impacts of manifest destiny and westward
00:59
expansion and what were reasons for and
01:02
goals of the nativist movement that
01:04
emerged during this time alright let's
01:07
take a look at Roman numeral one it
01:09
states popular enthusiasm for US
01:11
expansion bolstered by economic and
01:13
security interest resulted in the
01:15
acquisition of new territories
01:17
substantial migration westward and new
01:19
overseas initiatives so not only is the
01:22
u.s. expanding within the present-day
01:23
continental united states they also are
01:25
expanding beyond its borders
01:28
now what were reasons for westward
01:30
migration while you want while their
01:32
arguments for access to natural and
01:34
mineral resources specially gold out
01:36
west the California Gold Rush in the
01:39
1840s we see Comstock Lode was a mined
01:42
for silver and settled settlements were
01:44
built around resources so you literally
01:46
literally see towns popping up around
01:48
these resources
01:49
you also have economic opportunities
01:51
this idea the safety valve theory which
01:53
will emerge a little bit later but this
01:55
is the idea that one could always pack
01:57
up and move out west and make money so
01:59
even if you are a poor factory worker in
02:01
New York City for example there's always
02:04
a safety valve of moving out west as a
02:07
farmer in making a decent living and a
02:10
third reason for westward migration was
02:12
religious refuge we have groups like the
02:14
Mormons who were led by this dude bring
02:16
him young to move west to Utah because
02:19
they were being persecuted for their
02:20
beliefs in other areas reasons for
02:23
manifest destiny now before we start
02:25
talking about manifest destiny be
02:26
familiar with this visual super super
02:29
super important you definitely need to
02:31
know and be able to break it down notice
02:33
how it's very clear and bright over here
02:35
and it's dark where America is going but
02:38
it looks like Columbia here will be
02:40
bringing the light with her also notice
02:43
the different modes of transportation
02:44
you have wagons you have railroads you
02:47
have Columbia stringing telegraph lines
02:49
and you have farmers moving out west
02:52
this dude's got a pickaxe in his hand so
02:54
he's probably gonna look for gold or
02:55
some sort of minerals and Native
02:58
Americans are being forced further and
03:01
further west as well so what were some
03:04
reasons for a manifest destiny
03:05
it was the spread of US institution
03:07
institutions and believes a lot of
03:10
people felt that the US should expand
03:12
democracy and its government across the
03:15
borders there are also economic motives
03:17
for access to land a lot of farmers
03:19
again wanted to be able to gain more
03:21
land out west and there are different
03:24
ways of the u.s. acquired land one
03:26
through the mexican-american war
03:27
the u.s. defeated Mexico and gained
03:29
what's known as the Mexican Cession this
03:32
area over here California and these
03:34
areas in blue so essentially the u.s.
03:36
gained one third of its size from the
03:39
Mexican Cession there's also
03:41
negotiations things like the GATS then
03:43
purchase in which the u.s. gained this
03:45
little area of land in yellow and they
03:47
hope to build a Transcontinental
03:48
Railroad now please take a moment if you
03:51
have not already you can even pause this
03:53
video YouTube Jimmy Fallon gets them
03:56
purchase and it will be some of the
03:58
funniest four minutes of your life I
04:00
promise
04:01
also though I got territory up here the
04:04
u.s. settled with Britain along the u.s.
04:07
Canadian border and they established the
04:09
boundary at the 49th parallel now this
04:12
land acquisition did lead to debates
04:14
over things like slavery David well Mont
04:17
was a congressman from Pennsylvania and
04:21
he introduced the Wilmot Proviso and he
04:23
sought to ban slavery in the Mexican
04:26
and this is kind of the idea of the free
04:28
soil party which sought the non
04:29
extension of slavery so the the number
04:32
one debate will be over slavery well
04:33
this newly acquired land be free or
04:35
slave the status of Native Americans and
04:38
Mexicans was a debate how would they be
04:40
incorporated Mexicans after the
04:42
mexican-american war were given a choice
04:44
to become US citizens or moved to other
04:46
parts of Mexico and something like 90
04:48
percent of them chose to become US
04:50
citizens but there was debate over the
04:52
treatment of them US government
04:55
encouraged westward expansion in a
04:57
number of ways the Homestead Act was
04:58
passed in 1862 and established at homes
05:01
and established homesteads like the one
05:03
in the picture here this would provide
05:05
160 acres of land with a promise to live
05:08
on and improve the land for five years
05:10
and the government also provided
05:12
subsidies or gave money and land to
05:14
railroads to expand out west during this
05:18
time the u.s. also sought initiatives
05:19
with Asia you have Matthew Perry and the
05:21
opening of Japan in the 1850s he goes
05:23
over he's like he's like hey what's up
05:25
Ross I want to go to Japan no friends
05:27
joke for you and the u.s. begins trading
05:30
with Japan and clipper ships emerge and
05:33
these allow for trade faster trade with
05:36
other countries in particular China
05:38
which the u.s. sought to trade tea with
05:40
and missionaries were established in
05:42
China to spread a Christianity also so
05:45
let's take a look at Roman numeral two
05:47
it states in the 1840s 1850s Americans
05:50
continue to bake questions about rights
05:52
and citizenship for various groups of US
05:54
inhabitants we have immigration from
05:56
Europe and Asia when we're talking about
05:58
European immigrants there's Chu in
06:00
particular we're going to talk about the
06:02
Irish they tend to settle in cities in
06:04
the north northeast and they were mostly
06:06
catholic and they came over because of
06:08
the Irish potato famine going on during
06:11
the 1840s what's known as the dark 40s
06:13
Germans are the other European group
06:15
during this time that they tended to
06:17
settle in the frontier as farmers and
06:19
the Midwest and places like Ohio
06:21
particularly Cincinnati and then even
06:23
st. Louis as well and many immigrant
06:27
children attended parochial schools or
06:29
private schools and this would really
06:30
upset many Americans Asian immigrants
06:33
during this time tend to settle on the
06:35
west coast and the Chinese came over in
06:38
large numbers in the 1850s they
06:39
when working gold mines factories and
06:41
they also do farming as well and later
06:44
we'll talk about in period sex the
06:46
Chinese Exclusion Act in 1880 to forbid
06:48
Chinese immigration and both immigrants
06:52
both groups of immigrants Europeans and
06:54
Asian's they tended to settle in ethnic
06:57
communities and they would preserve
06:58
their own cultures if you've ever been
07:00
to in New York or San Francisco or
07:02
Washington they have Chinatown that is a
07:05
section of that city that is a specific
07:08
ethnic community with emergence of
07:12
nativism which is the fear hatred
07:14
distrust of foreigners and here's a very
07:17
well known political cartoon you should
07:18
be familiar that we have Irish here and
07:20
Germans over here and notice they're
07:22
stealing the ballot box they tended to
07:24
vote Democratic major argument for the
07:27
nativist used against groups like the
07:29
Irish in particular where that the Irish
07:31
were Catholics this nativism movements
07:33
heavily anti-catholic and they sought to
07:36
limit immigrants political power I can't
07:38
stress enough how important that is they
07:39
wanted to limit immigrants political
07:42
power the know-nothing party emerged
07:45
during this time this was an
07:46
anti-immigrant anti-catholic party and
07:48
they sought to limit the power and
07:50
influence of immigrants I can't state
07:52
that enough please make sure you know
07:54
that during this time we also have
07:56
conflicts with Mexican Americans and
07:57
natives in 1864 while the civil war is
08:00
going on we had the Sand Creek Massacre
08:01
in which a Colorado militia attacked
08:04
Cheyenne Indians they killed over 100
08:06
Indians mostly women and children with
08:09
the Battle of Little Bighorn was which
08:11
is also known as Custer's last stand
08:12
this is where natives attacked and
08:14
killed Custer and his men and the u.s.
08:17
sought to assimilate many natives with
08:20
expectation they would adopt white ways
08:22
and this will be a continuing theme into
08:24
period six where we'll spend a lot more
08:26
time on it all right some test tips for
08:29
you four or five point one for multiple
08:31
choice and short answer be able to
08:32
identify and explain reasons from AFS
08:35
destiny the impacts of the
08:36
mexican-american war on slavery hint the
08:39
debate will be over whether the land
08:41
should be free or slave what were ways
08:42
to us encourage westward expansion what
08:45
was nativism what were causes for it and
08:47
examples of it and for essays how did
08:50
westward expansion lead to tensions
08:53
over slavery I can't stress enough how
08:55
often that has been asked in some
08:57
variation in the past and companion
08:59
experiences of immigrants with other
09:00
with another time period and when we get
09:03
into time period six you'll be able to
09:05
answer that a lot more all right guys
09:08
look forward to seeing right back here
09:09
four key concept 5.2 or we'll get into
09:12
the presidency of Abraham Lincoln in the

much for watching best of luck this year
00:33
alright let's take a look at key concept
00:35
5.2 it's States intensified by expansion
00:39
in deepening regional divisions debates
00:41
over slavery and other economic cultural
00:44
and political issues let the nation into
00:46
Civil War I have lots of videos in the
00:49
description so if there's anything in
00:51
here you want more detail on check it
00:53
out lots of stuff in this video now some
00:57
big idea questions you should be able to
00:59
answer why did various government
01:01
actions regarding the issue of slavery
01:03
fail and why did the election of 1860
01:06
lead to secession by South Carolina and
01:10
other states that is a very important
01:13
event in US history
01:15
alright Roman number one states
01:16
ideological and economic differences
01:18
over slavery produced an array of
01:20
diverging responses from African
01:23
American Americans in the north and the
01:25
south so really in the antebellum period
01:28
in Antebellum means pre Civil War there
01:30
are two emerging economies that are very
01:32
disparate in America and in the north we
01:36
have manufacturing the relied on free
01:37
labor and the south we have agriculture
01:40
that is reliant heavily on slaver
01:42
especially for cotton the South's
01:46
nickname during this time is King cotton
01:48
because the economy is so dependent upon
01:50
it we have a free soil movement and this
01:53
emerges and the Free Soil movement it
01:56
sought to keep slavery from expanding
01:58
and the Free Soil party slogan was free
02:03
labor free soil free men and it was
02:05
coined by this dude salmon P chase who
02:08
goes on to be Lincoln's Treasury
02:10
secretary and the 6th Supreme Court
02:13
chief
02:13
justise he was also from Cincinnati Ohio
02:16
and the free saw moment really movement
02:20
really focused their efforts into the
02:22
land that is gained from the Mexican
02:24
Cession so that land out west and they
02:27
believe that slavery was incompatible
02:29
with free labor mostly because it took
02:31
away jobs and economic opportunities
02:33
from whites let's talk about an
02:36
abolitionist movement it was made up of
02:37
whites and blacks and although we tend
02:40
to think that in the North was against
02:41
slavery most people in the north would
02:43
not consider themselves abolitionists it
02:45
really made up a small percentage of the
02:47
people in the north their various
02:49
tactics that they used they would use
02:52
things like moral arguments this idea
02:53
that that slavery is incompatible with
02:55
natural rights and all men are created
02:57
equal and the Enlightenment ideas that
02:59
were used decades before they would help
03:01
assist slaves in their escapes most
03:03
notably the Underground Railroad
03:05
you have Harriet Tubman the very famous
03:07
conductor on the Underground Railroad
03:09
that helped that made dozens of trips
03:11
back to the south to help slaves escape
03:14
and here's a map of the Underground
03:15
Railroad you'll notice the end result
03:18
here is going to be Canada so a lot of
03:20
the cities where kind of ends are right
03:22
on the border with Canada here where I
03:23
live in Buffalo Niagara Falls is right
03:26
over here and let's played a huge role
03:27
now to ground red world because Canada
03:29
was right there there's also a
03:32
willingness to use violence you see this
03:34
at John Brown's raid at Harpers Ferry
03:36
which he took over a federal Arsenal and
03:38
hoping to eliminate slavery in the South
03:41
responded with various arguments that
03:42
would be used to defend slavery they
03:45
would use racial doctrines and this
03:46
argued that African Americans like
03:48
Native Americans before them were seen
03:50
as savages that they were less of humans
03:52
John T Calhoun and others argued that
03:55
slavery was a positive good that slaves
03:57
actually had it better off than northern
03:59
factory workers and they also pointed to
04:02
the Constitution and they believe that
04:03
states rights that slavery was protected
04:06
by states rights in the Supreme Court in
04:09
the in the court case Dred Scott vs.
04:12
Sanford which we'll talk about just a
04:13
moment stated that property couldn't be
04:15
taken away without due process in slaves
04:18
were therefore deemed property so the
04:20
South argued that slavery was upheld and
04:23
protected by the Constitution and
04:25
through states rights
04:27
okay Roman numeral two states and
04:29
debates over slavery came to dominate
04:30
political discussions in the 1850s and
04:33
this culminated in the bitter election
04:36
of 1860 and the secession of southern
04:39
states so we had the Mexican Cession
04:41
when the u.s. won the mexican-american
04:43
war they gained all this land out in the
04:46
present-day southwest portion of the
04:48
United States and this led to debates
04:49
over slavery nowhere do we see this more
04:52
so then the Wilmot Proviso this was an
04:55
amendment to a bill during the
04:57
mexican-american war introduced by David
04:59
Wilmot and he sought to ban slavery in
05:01
the Mexican Cession this is the idea of
05:04
the Free Soil party the idea of keeping
05:05
slavery from spreading now of note it's
05:09
important to note that the Wilmot
05:10
Proviso will pass the House but it does
05:12
not pass the Senate and the reason it
05:14
passes the House is there are more
05:16
people living in the north where the
05:17
North has an advantage in the house but
05:19
they do not have an advantage in the
05:21
Senate because at this time the number
05:23
of states were equal so the Wilmot
05:26
Proviso sought to keep slavery from
05:28
spreading in the south did everything in
05:30
its power to keep that from passing
05:32
definitely know that this to me is
05:34
screaming a stimulus for a multiple
05:37
choice question or even a short answer
05:38
question if you're writing an essay
05:40
about slavery this is something you want
05:42
to include as well okay so let's talk
05:45
about attempts to resolve slavery issue
05:46
in the territories through the courts we
05:48
the Dred Scott vs. Sanford case and here
05:50
is Dred Scott he was a slave who sued
05:53
for his freedom because he had been
05:54
taken to a free territory and the
05:56
Supreme Court ruled that African
05:58
Americans both free and slave were
06:00
deemed not to be citizens of the United
06:02
States and they could not sue this is a
06:04
very similar outcome to the Cherokee
06:06
Nation versus Georgia Supreme Court case
06:08
in which John Marshall stated that
06:10
Native Americans were not citizens and
06:12
could not sue furthermore the Supreme
06:15
Court under Roger B Taney declared that
06:17
slaves were considered property and they
06:19
could not be taken away I mention that
06:20
earlier the Fifth Amendment states that
06:22
individuals cannot be deprived of life
06:25
liberty or property without due process
06:26
and finally the Supreme Court also said
06:29
that Congress could not regulate slavery
06:31
in the territories so that Missouri
06:33
Compromise which was already overturned
06:35
by the kansas-nebraska Act is now
06:37
officially dead and this is in 1857 and
06:40
this
06:41
really infuriates the north they begin
06:44
to view it as more of an opinion not
06:46
necessarily something set in stone this
06:48
really creates a lot of tensions between
06:49
the north and the south
06:51
this will also split the Democratic
06:53
Party along sectional lines you'll see
06:55
people like Stephen Douglas in the north
06:57
get a lot of support but he will not get
06:59
support from Democrats in the south
07:01
continue with attempts we have national
07:04
leaders people like Henry Clay and
07:05
Stephen Douglas with the compromise of
07:07
1850 major parts that you should know
07:10
California was added as a free state and
07:12
this will tip the balance in favor of
07:14
the free states the slave trade was
07:16
abolished in Washington DC not slavery
07:18
but the slave trade and the reason why
07:20
was there were a lot of foreign
07:22
dignitaries who would come to Washington
07:23
DC and would be horrified at the slave
07:25
trade we have popular sovereignty in the
07:28
Mexican Cession which allowed people
07:29
living there to vote whether or not the
07:32
territory should be free or slave and we
07:34
also have the passage of a more strict
07:36
Fugitive Slave Law this is the most
07:38
controversial part of the compromise of
07:40
1850 this states that northerners had to
07:42
actively become involved in the
07:44
retrieval of runaway slaves many North
07:47
northerners day like this and they pass
07:48
personal liberty laws which forbid the
07:51
use of courtrooms and jails for the
07:54
retrieval of runaway slaves that's
07:55
essentially nullifying a federal law in
07:58
the south would be very upset with it
08:00
the kids Sabratha act a few years later
08:02
was created by Stephen Douglas this
08:04
allowed for popular sovereignty in
08:06
Kansas and Nebraska and the expectation
08:10
was this unwritten rule as a kids would
08:11
be slave in Nebraska would be free now
08:14
it's important to note that both of
08:15
these are located in the Louisiana
08:17
Purchase territory and both of them are
08:19
above that 3630 line so this essentially
08:22
reverses the Missouri Compromise in this
08:25
help lead to the creation of the
08:26
Republican Party because so many people
08:29
were upset with this act and they wanted
08:32
to keep slavery from spreading that's
08:33
going to be the platform of the
08:35
Republican Party to keep slavery from
08:37
spreading so with the end of the second
08:39
party system the Whig party ceases to
08:41
exist and this occurs due to issues over
08:43
slavery and anti-immigration sentiment
08:46
again keep in mind that know-nothing
08:47
party that we talked about in the last
08:49
key concept video this will lead to the
08:51
emergence of sectional parties and we'll
08:53
see this in the election
08:54
60 in just a moment and the Republican
08:56
Party will emerge and it will become
08:58
very popular in the north and the Mid
09:00
West
09:01
this is made up of Free Soilers again
09:03
people want to keep slavery from
09:04
expanding and former Whigs it is so
09:08
important to note that in 1860 Lincoln's
09:10
platform was the non extension of
09:12
slavery he did not want to ban slavery
09:13
he want to keep it from extending so in
09:17
1860 Lincoln will win on a free soil
09:19
platform without a single southern
09:22
electoral vote from the south so if you
09:25
take a look here this picture will go in
09:26
just a second all the green states here
09:29
in the south they are going to be the
09:31
ones that eventually end up succeeding -
09:33
Maryland and Delaware over here but they
09:35
did not vote for Lincoln he doesn't win
09:37
a single liked or vote in the south and
09:38
the south would say wait a minute
09:40
Lincoln wins and none of us voted for
09:43
him therefore we have no control over
09:44
who the president is so they leave if
09:47
you notice here every state that voted
09:49
against Lincoln is a slave owning state
09:53
was a slave owning state he did not I
09:56
can't repeat this enough want to end
09:58
slavery but keep it from spreading we'll
09:59
see that change in the next key concept
10:02
video but for now he does not want to
10:04
end slavery this is the immediate cause
10:06
of the civil war if you see a question
10:08
about what was the immediate cause of
10:09
the Civil War it's going to be the
10:11
election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and
10:15
South Carolina will secede on December
10:17
20th 1860 and shortly after many other
10:20
states will follow suit alright let's go
10:22
over some test tips for multiple choices
10:23
short answer no the reasons for the
10:26
decline of the second party system
10:27
characteristics of the abolitionist
10:29
movement different tactics that they
10:31
used the compromise of 1850
10:33
kansas-nebraska act in the Dred Scott
10:34
decision
10:35
all of them are fair game and I've
10:37
detailed videos on all of them in the
10:38
description and for essay topics ways
10:41
that the government sought to settle the
10:43
issue of slavery and that's going to
10:45
come right back to these things right
10:47
here all right guys look forward to
10:49
seeing you back here four key concept
10:50
five point three where we'll take a look
10:52
at the reading of this very famous
10:54
document Lincoln's hand the Emancipation
10:57
Proclamation
10:58
oh there's salmon P chase from
10:59
Cincinnati right there we'll talk about
11:01
him too and I look forward to seeing you
11:02
guys right back here thank you very much
11:04
for watching and have a good day
